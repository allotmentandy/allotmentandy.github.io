        <p>Over the weekend, I like to explore new ideas and find potential solutions to improve 
<a href="http://www.londinium.com" target="_blank">londinium.com</a>, discover new applications and find new code bases. One area I was looking at is the ability to get scores for websites. Many people have heard of Google PageRank and Alexa site ratings, but I want a get scores for a website on a variety of factors and use these to display a scorecard for each website url.</p>

<p>But now it is Monday morning and I like to start the week by updating the data by downloading a new data file from <a href="https://overpass-api.de/api/interpreter" target="_blank">https://overpass-api.de/api/interpreter</a></p>

<p>I import this into the database and then run a website spider over the links to find more data for each entry and see what has changed.</p>

<p>This is the overpass api query i run each week which covers a large area around London:</p>

<pre><code>data=[out:json];nwr[~"^(brand|website|twitter|facebook|contact:website|contact:twitter|contact:facebook)$"~"."]  
(51.11386850819646,-1.197509765625,51.92394344554469,0.85418701171875);out center;
</code></pre>

<p>There is a huge fall in the number of entries from last week, approx 55,000 this week, compared to 62,000 last week. I wonder what is causing this difference? I will investigate in a future blog post.</p>

<p>One error I was having with the spider is when a field it too long for the database field. For example, a <code>title</code> tag is longer than the 255 varchar field the database allows. One of the nice things in Laravel, is the ability to use <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/helpers" target="_blank">helpers</a> where the <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/helpers#method-str-limit" target="_blank">Str::limit</a> helper allows me to truncate the string to the correct length, thus preventing the error.</p>

<p>Another feature of the spider is to determine the HTTP response codes for the website. Here is a table of the most common results and their meanings.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>HTTP Code</th>
  <th>Count</th>
  <th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>200</td>
  <td>30592</td>
  <td>OK</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>404</td>
  <td>2167</td>
  <td>Not Found</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>403</td>
  <td>739</td>
  <td>Forbidden</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>500</td>
  <td>76</td>
  <td>Internal Server Error</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>503</td>
  <td>75</td>
  <td>Service Unavailable</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>409</td>
  <td>22</td>
  <td>Conflict</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>400</td>
  <td>20</td>
  <td>Bad Request</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>410</td>
  <td>14</td>
  <td>Gone</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>And also a handful of the following HTTP codes: 429, 502, 401, 402, 530, 423, 415, 406, 521, 301, 300, 526, 426. These however are only a handful each.</p>

<p>Other errors which I am investigating occur when Guzzle returns</p>

<ul>
<li>request exception</li>
<li>connection exception</li>
<li>Undefined variable $response {"exception":"[object] (ErrorException(code: 0): Undefined variable $response ...</li>
</ul>

<p>More information about these errors at the <a href="https://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/stable/quickstart.html#exceptions" target="_blank">Guzzle Docs</a>}</p>

<p>Once this process is finished, the website will be updated with the new database tables and I also plan to update the site with a few more features based on this new spider table.</p>

<p>Enjoy..</p>

    <summary type="html">Calculating the distance from a latitude and londitude cordinate to a point in PHP....</summary>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>Today I decided to tackle the issue of ordering the website listings by distance from Central London. The traditional centre of London is Charing Cross, which is at a latitude of 51.509 and a longitude of -0.122, this is my centre point.</p>

<p>So i did a little search online and found this <code>PHP</code> function that calculates the distance from this point, for each entry in the database.</p>

<pre><code class="language-php">function distance($lat1, $lon1, $lat2, $lon2, $unit)
{
    $theta = $lon1 - $lon2;
    $dist = sin(deg2rad($lat1)) * sin(deg2rad($lat2)) +  cos(deg2rad($lat1)) * cos(deg2rad($lat2)) * cos(deg2rad($theta));
    $dist = acos($dist);
    $dist = rad2deg($dist);
    $miles = $dist * 60 * 1.1515;
    $unit = strtoupper($unit);

    if ($unit == "K") {
        return ($miles * 1.609344);
    } elseif ($unit == "N") {
        return ($miles * 0.8684);
    } else {
        return $miles;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>To get the distance from Charing Cross, it is simply a call to</p>

<pre><code class="language-php">  $distanceFrom = distance(51.509, -0.122, $lat, $lon, 'M');
</code></pre>

<p>To store it in the database I added a 'float' field into the mysql table like so:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">  `distance` float NOT NULL,
</code></pre>

<p>And updaed the Laravel Controller to order the result by this field</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">  ORDER BY distance ASC 
</code></pre>

<p>And hey presto, the lists of websites are now sorted by distance from Charing Cross!</p>

    <summary type="html">How I added the ability for the user to set their location using 2 cookies for the features and brands maps....</summary>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>My londinium.com website has 2 types of maps, fixed locations like postcodes, train stations and places, but also features and brands which are more relevant to the users location.</p>

<p>Today I tackled the issue of setting the user location with a cookie so that the features and brand maps are more relevant to the users location.</p>

<p>This was a project for javascripting.</p>

<p>I created a new page <a href="https://londinium.com/setLocation" target="_blank">setLocation</a> with the following function to set the cookie at the point of click.</p>

<pre><code>function onMapClick(e) {
    //map click event object (e) has latlng property which is a location at which the click occured.
    popup
        .setLatLng(e.latlng)
        .setContent("&lt;h2&gt;LOCATION COOKIE SET&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Lat " + e.latlng.lat + "&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long " +
            e.latlng.lng +
            "&lt;/strong&gt;")
        .openOn(mymap);
    lat = "lat=" + e.latlng.lat + '; path = /; sameSite=Lax;';
    long = "long=" + e.latlng.lng + '; path = /; sameSite=Lax;';
    document.cookie = lat;
    document.cookie = long;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And some new functionality to use the new cookie variables if set on the features and brand pages.</p>

<pre><code>    function getCookie(name) {
        // Split cookie string and get all individual name=value pairs in an array
        var cookieArr = document.cookie.split(";");

        // Loop through the array elements
        for (var i = 0; i &lt; cookieArr.length; i++) {
            var cookiePair = cookieArr[i].split("=");

            /* Removing whitespace at the beginning of the cookie name
            and compare it with the given string */
            if (name == cookiePair[0].trim()) {
                // Decode the cookie value and return
                return decodeURIComponent(cookiePair[1]);
            }
        }
        // Return null if not found
        return null;
    }
window.onload = function () {
    var Lat = 51.5
    var cookieLat = getCookie("lat");
    if (cookieLat != null) {
        Lat = getCookie("lat");
    }
    var Long = -0.144
    var cookieLong = getCookie("long");
    if (cookieLong != null) {
        Long = getCookie("long");
    }

    map = L.map('map').setView([Lat, Long], 14);
</code></pre>

<p>I am sure it could be improved, but it works and allows both a default and user set value.</p>

    <summary type="html">Making sitemaps for Google with a Laravel console command and an AWK one line command line script to process the routes file....</summary>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>Yesterday, I added Google Adsense to <a href="http://www.londinium.com" target="_blank">londinium.com</a> which has changed quite a bit since I last used it. Part of the process ended up with me in the Google Webmaster Tools, another area I have neglected, but a useful tool for SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) purposes.</p>

<p>One of the things it suggested was to create, was a sitemap.xml file for all the links in the site. Using Laravel, there are often a number of tools to complete any job, and I soon found and setup <a href="https://github.com/spatie/laravel-sitemap" target="_blank">github.com/spatie/laravel-sitemap</a> as a command line tool. However this is a tool that is going to crawl the entire website and with over 2000 routes, is a slow way to build this sitemap.</p>

<p>Google allows both .xml and .txt files according to the docs, see <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/sitemaps/build-sitemap" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/sitemaps/build-sitemap</a></p>

<p>So I changed tack and went back to using AWK. With this one script, I can extract all the routes and prefix them with the domain name and make the first one of these from the routes/web,php file with awk</p>

<pre><code>awk -F"'" '$1 ~ /^Route::/ {print"http://londinium.com"$2}' routes/web.php &gt; sitemap.txt
</code></pre>

<p>The second part is to create a list of the pages from the database. I have a table 'points' where I import OSM data which has a website. so I created an artisan console command which outputs these pages with the command <code>php artisan sitemap:generate &gt; sitemapNWR.txt</code>. It limits the select to 50000 as that is a limit imposed by Google. The commented out command will offset that query by 50,000.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

namespace App\Console\Commands;

use Illuminate\Console\Command;
use App\Models\Points;

class GenerateSitemap extends Command
{
    /**
     * The console command name.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    protected $signature = 'sitemap:generate';

    /**
     * The console command description.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    protected $description = 'Make a sitemap of all the db pages from the points table.';

    /**
     * Execute the console command.
     *
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function handle()
    {
        $points = Points::limit(50000)-&gt;get();
        //$points = Points::skip(50000)-&gt;take(50000)-&gt;get();

        $points-&gt;each(function ($point) {
            echo "http://londinium.com/". $point-&gt;nwr. "/" .  $point-&gt;id;
            echo PHP_EOL;
        });
    }
}

</code></pre>

<p>It is now 2 simple commands, which i can upload to Google Webmaster Search Console.</p>

<p>Another job done!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>After yesterdays fun with Node JS, i have downgraded the version of Node in the ansible settings to version 12.</p>

<p><code>ufw</code> firewall is now enabled in a new role and I added each port for <code>apache</code> I use and also allowed ssh access.</p>

<p><code>Composer</code> was complaining that i didnt have the <code>php-curl</code> module so i installed that too</p>

<p>Laravel Dusk wasnt working so I have added <code>chromium</code> and had to rerun the php artisan dusk:install to setup the chromedirver for the tests.</p>

<p>However PHP wasnt working perfectly, i needed to enable <code>a2enmod proxy_fcgi</code> for it to work with .php files.</p>

<p>VS-code didnt like the fact <code>php-codesniffer</code> wasnt installed so I added it.</p>

<p>Also added a few apps that I like to use including <code>deluge</code>, <code>krita</code> and <code>fzf</code>. <code>fzf</code> is a fuzzy find for the commandline and I added a alias for <code>lf</code> to allow me to perform a fuzzy find on the directory with the following code which i added to the end of <code>.bashrc</code></p>

<pre><code>#bashrc - add lf for fzf andy alias
 lf () { ls -lah | fzf -e -q "$@" ;}
</code></pre>

<p>The biggest problem I had was trying to get Ansible to setup <code>mysql/mariadb</code>. The root user needs to have the plugin changed to <code>mysql_native_password</code>. But I did it by hand, as I didnt get this working with ansible yet!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>Spent most of the morning struggling to get <code>npm run production</code> working on my new machine. The problem was a combination of things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Node JS version</li>
<li>Laravel Mix version</li>
<li>Tailwind CSS</li>
<li>Webpack</li>
</ul>

<p>Solutions I tried:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">npm install laravel-mix-purgecss@6.0.0
npm install --save-dev sass-loader@7.1.0
npm install node-sass@v4
npm install --save-dev cross-env
npm install postcss-loader@~3.0.0 --save-dev
npm install -D tailwindcss@npm:@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat @tailwindcss/postcss7-compat postcss@\^7 autoprefixer@\^9 --force
</code></pre>

<p>Downgrade Node to version 12, then deleted the entire node_modules directory and reinstalled with the original package.json file.</p>

<p>Then fixed more errors until it worked.</p>

<p>This is now my package.json file</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">{

<p>Once I got this all working, my ansible script then reinstalled v.14 of Node JS :) so now updating the ansible scripts to install v.12.</p>

<p>Most of a day of experimenting with the behemoth that is the world of Node JS :)</p>

<h3>Edit 28th Feb 2022</h3>

<p>I ran into this same problem again with another site. I added webpack 4 to the dependencies</p>

<pre><code>        "webpack": "^4.00.0"
</code></pre>

<p>and did a hard reinstall of all the node modules!</p>

<pre><code>rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm cache clear --force
npm install

        <p>I do like testing websites, both as I code them, after they are running, but also to extract the odd snippet of data.</p>

<p>Laravel has a Browser testing environment called <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/dusk">Dusk</a></p>

<p>It uses the chrome browser to test a website as a human would use it.</p>

<p>It can also make screenshots at different sizes to mirror different size screens.</p>

<p>Having moved to a new machine, copied over the code base, the dusk tests were failing. To fix it i needed to run</p>

<pre><code>apt-get install chromium

php artisan dusk:install

</code></pre>

<p>I have added these to the ansible setup which I will blog about in the future.</p>

<p>Whilst writing the tests, i wanted a way to just run the single test rather than the entire suite. This calls just the one test:</p>

<pre><code>php artisan dusk tests/Browser/blog404Test.php
</code></pre>

<p>What i wanted to test for was that a page isnt found and returns a 404 error page. Dusk cant do that directly, so the dusk test looks for '404' to appear in the page. But dusk tests can also run vanilla phpunit tests which can assert the status is 404.</p>

<pre><code>        $this-&gt;browse(function (Browser $browser) {
            $browser-&gt;visit('https://allotmentandy.github.io/missingPage/')
                    -&gt;assertSee('404');

            $response = $this-&gt;get('https://allotmentandy.github.io/missingPage/')
                        -&gt;assertStatus(404);
        }
</code></pre>

<p>I also wanted to test that there was no errors in the console;</p>

<pre><code>            $consoleLog = ($browser-&gt;driver-&gt;manage()-&gt;getLog('browser'));
            $this-&gt;assertEqualsCanonicalizing($consoleLog, []);
</code></pre>

<p>This creates an Array of the console output and asserts it is a blank array. Simples!</p>

        <p>I recently bought a new computer and wanted to use Ansible to install all the software. I have installed the base debian system and now wanted to install everything I regularly use with Ansible.</p>

<p>Here is the link to the repo</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/allotmentandy/ansible-debian-install-desktop" target="_blank">github.com/allotmentandy/ansible-debian-install-desktop</a></p>

<p>Inspired by the following repos on github, I wanted to install as much as possible with Ansible, including settings for software, the XFCE panels and copy over the files I want as a backup.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/liquuid/ansible-desktop-debian" target="_blank">https://github.com/liquuid/ansible-desktop-debian</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook" target="_blank">https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/alecigne/ansible-desktop" target="_blank">https://github.com/alecigne/ansible-desktop</a></p>

<p>I have used installed a lot of software but the core apps I wanted is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sublime Text</li>
<li>Sublime Merge</li>
<li>Google Chrome</li>
<li>VS Code</li>
<li>Brave Browser</li>
<li>php7.4</li>
<li>php8.0</li>
<li>Apache2</li>
<li>MySQL / MariaDB Ver 15.1 Distrib 10.5.12-MariaDB,</li>
<li>Virtual Box</li>
<li>Terraform</li>
<li>Ansible</li>
<li>Docker</li>
<li>nodejs version 14.9</li>
<li>npm</li>
<li>Terminology</li>
<li>Firefox</li>
<li>Thunderbird</li>
</ul>

<p>a number of extra repositories for software was required and features in the roles within the repository.</p>

<p>To run the ansible playbook run this command and enter the ssh password and the root password like so:</p>

<pre><code>ansible-playbook -i hosts workstation.yml --ask-become-pass --ask-pass 

SSH password:
BECOME password[defaults to SSH password]:
</code></pre>

<p>One of the issues was that I tend to use su instead of the default sudo, and this requires <code>become_method: su</code> which is set in the <code>ansible_cfg</code> file</p>

<p>I will extend this as I need to, and update the blog and the repo. Hope it is of some help. If you have any feedback, issues or suggestions, please contact me.</p>

    <title>Adding Pages For Each Node Way Relation To Londinium</title>

    <summary type="html">how I added a details page for each node, way or relation on Londinium.com...</summary>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>Today I took on the challenge of adding pages that display all the details stored about an object in the Open Street Map system. These come as Nodes, Ways and Relations which has data associated with it available via the Overpass API.</p>

<p>Using the <a href="https://github.com/plepe/overpass-frontend" target="_blank">https://github.com/plepe/overpass-frontend</a> I used the by ID function to display the a single Node, Way or Relation using the format n123, w123 and r123 respectively to make the overpass api query.</p>

<p>This is the code in the github readme:</p>

<pre><code>const OverpassFrontend = require('overpass-frontend')

// you may specify an OSM file as url, e.g. 'test/data.osm.bz2'
const overpassFrontend = new OverpassFrontend('//overpass-api.de/api/interpreter')

// request restaurants in the specified bounding box
overpassFrontend.get(
  ['n27365030', 'w5013364'],
  {
    properties: OverpassFrontend.TAGS
  },
  function (err, result) {
    if (result) {
      console.log('* ' + result.tags.name + ' (' + result.id + ')')
    } else {
      console.log('* empty result')
    }
  },
  function (err) {
    if (err) { console.log(err) }
  }
)
</code></pre>

<p>Here is an example of one of each of the 3 types:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.londinium.com/node/6371429623" target="_blank">/node/6371429623</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.londinium.com/way/175968074" target="_blank">/way/175968074</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.londinium.com/relation/9653407" target="_blank">/relation/9653407</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Each page displays a smaller map with a list of the data stored, which is returned from the overpass API call.</p>

<p>It took me a bit of fiddling to get the data to display but it works!</p>

<p>One thing I also managed to solve was the ability to add a <code>loading data...</code> block to the header which i have implemented on every map page to show the user that the data is loading. It isnt as quick I would like, but at least it provides the user with feedback.</p>

    <summary type="html">Adding maps of Brands to Londinium.com...</summary>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>Today I have added the first Brand pages to <a href="http://www.londinium.com" target="_blank">londinium.com</a></p>

<p>These are pages that have 9 entries or more of the following tags</p>

<ul>
<li>Brand</li>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Operator</li>
</ul>

<p>One issue i ran into straight away was brands with apostrophes in them. Eg Nando's, Mcdonald's, Sainsbury's, Papa John's and more.</p>

<p>Using this guide to Overpass API regex, <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_QL#Key.2Fvalue_matches_regular_expression_.28.7E.22key_regex.22.7E.22value_regex.22.29" target="_blank">https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_QL</a></p>

<p>My solution for now is to only match the start of the term, so I use Sainsbury, Nando etc. with the following regex overpass api query:</p>

<pre><code class="language-php">(nwr["name"~"^{{$brand}}"];  nwr["brand"~"^{{$brand}}"];  nwr["operator"~"^{{$brand}}"]; );
</code></pre>

<p>This method also allows the query to match <code>Tesco</code>, <code>Tesco Metro</code>, <code>Tesco Express</code> all from the <code>Tesco</code> query.</p>

<p>To investigate all the brands, names and operators, i once again created a database import script to create a mysql table for brands and extracted the fields from the osm json.</p>

<p>To find the most common brands I used this sql query:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT LOWER(brand) , brand, COUNT(brand) as cnt  
FROM brands
GROUP BY brand
HAVING cnt &gt; 9
</code></pre>

<p>This provided the following with at least 10 entries for my London area</p>

<pre><code>Asda    210
Domino's    184
Boots   144
Lloyds Bank 138

<p>Many of these chains dont have the fields for every branch, which can be fixed by adding the correct brand in the OpenStreetMap system. I can do this for you. get in touch if you would like help improving the data stored in this open source map system.</p>

    <summary type="html">My attempt to add a new route:check command failed as the core getRoutes function removes duplicates. So i wrote it using AWK....</summary>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>Today I tried to create a new subcommand for the <code>php artisan route:list</code> command by adding a <code>--duplicates</code> option.</p>

<p>I edited the command in <code>/vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Foundation/Console/RouteListCommand.php</code>
adding an option and a sub function into getRoutes for duplicates. But it seemed to only have a single entry for each route. The problem is the getRoutes function removes all duplicates, so my array function only counted 1 for each.</p>

<p>So i gave up and wrote this awk command line script to find duplicates in the web.php routes file:</p>

<pre><code>awk -F"'" '$1 ~ /^Route::/ {print $2}' routes/web.php | awk 'NF &gt; 0' | sort | uniq -c -d 
</code></pre>

<p>It finds all lines starting with "Route::" and prints the second awk column $2 which is then sorted and the -d on uniq show duplicates.</p>

<p>it outputs a list of routes with a count higher than 1, like so.</p>

<pre><code>2 contact
2 az
</code></pre>

<p>I am sure it could be improved, but it solved the problem for me and helped me find the duplicates in a sinlge line.</p>

    <summary type="html">Scripting the terminal to open 5 tabs with titles, change to the correct directory and make the root one red....</summary>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>I like to have a load of Terminal tabs open in different directories, but creating them by hand with Ctrl-T gives them the boring 'Bash' Title. I use <a href="https://github.com/borisfaure/terminology" target="_blank">Terminology</a>  Lets see if we can automate it that and create terminal tabs with names and set the location.</p>

<p>I want 5 tabs with the following</p>

<ul>
<li>Blog Root</li>
<li>Website Root</li>
<li>Website Testing Root</li>
<li>Desktop</li>
<li>ROOT User</li>
</ul>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/allotmentandy/fbb0cae7f50e7800caec87765ca7df9a.js"></script>

<p>I am using xdotool and have to press <code>enter</code> at the end of each type command. I also place a space before each command so it doesnt get stored in the command history.</p>

<p>The root one on the end, doesnt login as root, rather leaves the command ready to be run.</p>

<p>I like to have the terminal with tab titles, it is a pain to do it by hand. Also embedding the gist from github which is a better place to keep the shell scripts.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoy it.</p>

        <p>I have lots of ideas and improvements I would like to make to the <a href="http://www.londinium.com" target="_blank">londinium.com</a> website. Here I am going to document a few with brief outlines and potential solutions</p>

<h3>1. Loading data from api - info box - show progress/errors</h3>

<ul>
<li>see <a href="https://allotmentandy.github.io/blog/2022-01-19-Using-Overpass-API-Mirrors-CORS-Errors" target="_blank">previous blog</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Show a list of the data below the map</h3>

<p>I am about to upload a new feature for the area pages, where the page shows a table of results with websites nearest the centre point of the map. Perhaps this could be created dynamically from the live overpass data.</p>

<ul>
<li>like in this sidebar - <a href="http://xover.mud.at/~skunk/overpass-layer/?pt" target="_blank">http://xover.mud.at/~skunk/overpass-layer/?pt</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Different colours for different features on the map</h3>

<p>This map uses OpenLayers, but displays the different sort of features with different colours.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/vector-osm-forked-r84m9?file=/main.js" target="_blank">https://codesandbox.io/s/vector-osm-forked-r84m9?file=/main.js</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Location - set a location page and use this with cookies.</h3>

<p>Create a page to set the location. Here are a few links to examples of geolocation using html5</p>

<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_geolocation" target="_blank">https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_geolocation</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/How-to-use-HTML5-Geolocation-Latitude-Longitude-API" target="_blank">https://www.tutorialspoint.com/How-to-use-HTML5-Geolocation-Latitude-Longitude-API</a></p>

<h3>5. Map to show all of a brand name, eg, waitrose, lidl</h3>

<p>This is the Overpass API Query to get all Waitroses in the BBOX area.</p>

<pre><code>[out:json][timeout:25];
(
  // query part for: “shop=* and name=Waitrose
  nwr["shop"]["name"="Waitrose"]({{bbox}});
  // query part for: “shop=* and brand=Waitrose
  nwr["shop"]["brand"="Waitrose"]({{bbox}});
  // query part for: “shop=* and operator=Waitrose
  nwr["shop"]["operator"="Waitrose"]({{bbox}});
);
// print results
out body;
&gt;;
out skel qt;

</code></pre>

<h3>6. Testing the json from the API is loading using Laravel Dusk.</h3>

<ul>
<li>Improving the tests to see if the api is working</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Adding a Search facility for the maps to find features and places.</h3>

<ul>
<li>use Google Adsense</li>
<li>use a search like this blog using a json file.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Improving the map popup to deal with non-valid website links and adding more data fields.</h3>

<p>This is just a vague idea, but at present, a url field will be linked, but there is a large number of urls without the http/https element, which makes it an internal link.</p>

    <summary type="html">Investigating using different Overpass API servers, fixing the CORS error and adding a loading message......</summary>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>I was investigating adding a loading block to the website and posted a number of messages like this online <a href="https://forum.openstreetmap.org/viewtopic.php?id=74656" target="_blank">forum.openstreetmap.org/viewtopic.php?id=74656 </a> where i wrote:</p>

<p>I am looking for help adding a loading message as the overpass API data takes a good few seconds to load. Basically, I am looking to add a box to the map that says loading data, refering to the load of the results from the /api/interpreter which you can see in the browser dev tools.</p>

<p>eg</p>

<pre><code>Loading data ......
26kb received

OR 

Error - 426 - Server too busy - please try again
</code></pre>

<p>I am not sure if at the start of the page load, there is an idea to how much data will come in, The data seems to come in 'waves', but also errors if there is too many requests, I want to be able to display this as a layer in the map, and for it to reappear when the page is moved.</p>

<p>One of the replies pointed me to this list of mirrors of the data <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API#Public_Overpass_API_instances" target="_blank">https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API#Public_Overpass_API_instances</a></p>

<p>Trying out the api from <a href="https://kumi.systems/" target="_blank">https://kumi.systems/</a> I got a CORS error, which complains about a Cross-Origin Request, so i added this php at the start to fix that.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://overpass.kumi.systems/');
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Have been in contact with the team at Kumi Systems and hope to find a solution to the loading issue and see if there API mirror is any faster.</p>

<p>Another reply suggested hosting your own overpass api, which is installed like so, <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Installation" target="_blank">https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Installation</a>
I may look at this solution in the future....</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>I wanted to improve the area maps on <a href="http://www.londinium.com" target="_blank">londinium.com</a> by adding a list of the websites nearby to each location. I started with the query I blogged about a few posts back, so I started with just the nodes, but large objects like hospitals didnt appear in the first list. This is because they are not nodes, rather ways and relations. The problem with these non-nodes is that they didnt have a lat/long in the same way the nodes did. But I found you could use the center output mode and replace <code>out</code> with <code>out center</code> so i my query for extracting websites is now put in a query file called <code>query.osm</code> like so:</p>

<pre><code>data=[out:json];nwr[~"^(website|twitter|facebook|contact:website|contact:twitter|contact:facebook)$"~"."]  (51.11386850819646,-1.197509765625,51.92394344554469,0.85418701171875);out center;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the export area is encoded in the query, and the output format is json.</p>

<p>To download the osm data with this command using the 'query.osm' file above run:</p>

<pre><code>wget -O osm.json --post-file=query.osm "https://overpass-api.de/api/interpreter"
</code></pre>

<p>To parse the <code>osm.json</code> file to extract data and create an insert sql file, I amended my parseXml.php file like so</p>

<p>I am now donwloading json, so i needed to change the parse file a lot. It is much cleaner and easier with json to extract the data</p>

<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php

error_reporting(E_ALL ^ E_WARNING); // disable warnings as this is an sql import

$json = file_get_contents('osm.json');
$phpDataArray = json_decode($json, false ); 

foreach($phpDataArray as $value){

    foreach($value as $row){

        if ($row-&gt;tags-&gt;website){    $website = $row-&gt;tags-&gt;website;}
        else    $website = $row-&gt;tags-&gt;{'contact:website'};

        // if the website is not valid or blank - continue, ignoring this row
        if (filter_var($website, FILTER_VALIDATE_URL) === false) {
            continue;
        }

        if ($row-&gt;id){

            else    $linkedin = $row-&gt;tags-&gt;{'contact:linkedin'};

            // make the sql using INSERT IGNORE to prevent errors
            echo "INSERT IGNORE INTO `points` (`id`, `website`, `address`, `feature` ,`amenity` ,`building` ,
            `tourism` ,`craft` , `twitter`,  `facebook`,  `linkedin`, `instagram`,  `name`, `nwr`, `point`) ";
            echo "VALUES(" . $row-&gt;id .", '" . addslashes($website) . "', '". addslashes(trim($address)) . "', '".
             addslashes($feature) . "', '" .addslashes($amenity) . "', '" .addslashes($building) . "', '" .
             addslashes($tourism) . "', '" .addslashes($craft) . "', '" . $twitter . "', '". $facebook

            echo PHP_EOL;
        }
    }
}


</code></pre>

<p>To create the sql file, I ran it like this</p>

<pre><code>parseJson.php &gt; points.sql
</code></pre>

<p>I had to extract the <code>nwr</code> (Node/Way/Relation) to be able to link to the live db database on openstreetmap. I also renamed the field <code>type</code> as <code>feature</code> so the new database table is like so:</p>

<pre><code class="language-mysql">CREATE TABLE `points` (
  `id` varchar(11) NOT NULL,
  `nwr` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `feature` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `amenity` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `building` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `tourism` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `craft` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `address` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `website` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `twitter` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `facebook` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `linkedin` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `instagram` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `point` point NOT NULL,

  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  SPATIAL KEY `point` (`point`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB;
</code></pre>

<p>import into db using pipe viewer to see progress</p>

<pre><code>pv points.sql | mysql -u root -p  londinium
</code></pre>

<p>And hey presto, a table full of data with each entity having geographic data.</p>

<p>There is still a number of 'dodgy' entries, which i plan to clean up at the next stage of this this import.</p>

        <p>Having spent the past month focusing on devops with AWS, I have decided to do the Terraform Associate Certification. It is coming to the new year, new month, so i get a new allocation of 750 hours on AWS to play with.

    <summary type="html">I was asked this question on twitter, so I wrote a blog post answering it...</summary>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/plepe" target="_blank">plepe</a> the developer of the <a href="https://github.com/plepe/overpass-layer" target="_blank">javascript toolkit</a> I use to get the data from the overpass API asked me a couple of questions over on twitter.</p>

<p><strong>What are you trying to achieve? Do you want to tell people about your script? Are you looking for co-developers? Are you looking for ideas?</strong></p>

<p>Over 20 years ago, i register the domain name Londinium.com and spent many years building a large directory website focused on London. Around 2015, Google kicked the directories like mine from their search engine results, alongside regular Denial of Service attacks, the EU cookie directive and other factors, I decided to take the website down as it was no longer making any money.</p>

<p>Now I have relaunched londinium.com with the maps from Open Street Map and using the Overpass API, i hope to be able to provide a map based solution for people looking for local information and more.</p>

<p>One idea I have is to contribute all the data to Openstreetmap. I have developed a number of web spiders, crawlers and tools to find website information. This includes checking websites work, extracting links from websites, content from web pages and screenshots of websites.</p>

<p>I would like to make use of these tools to clean the data returned from the overpass api, (eg. fixing links to websites that are missing the http:// part) I would also like to use the tools I have written to add more links to social media like twitter, facebook and also to youtube, flickr and more. My tools also extract data from the Head of the websites like ICBM location and other Meta tag data.</p>

<p>As a PHP developer with a geography background, I mainly work with the Laravel framework. Much of the OSM technology is Javascript based, and although I have coded londinium.com so far, javascript is not my strongest skill. I would like to find other people that use similar technologies (<code>leaflet js</code>, <code>overpass api</code> ) willing to share and help each other.</p>

<p>I would also like to open source the technology once it has reached a stable state. Not only the frontend website, but the backend tools that find, check and update information held.</p>

<p>One thing I would like to add is a "Loading..." modal to say that the Overpass API data is loading on the live site. Not entirely sure how to do this.</p>

<p>Another question with regards to developers, is where do they hangout? Is the <a href="https://forum.openstreetmap.org/viewforum.php?id=13" target="_blank">forum</a> the correct place to paste the link to this post, or are the mailing lists better. Is there a chatroom or irc channel in which  openstreetmap folk dwell?</p>

<p>I may well update this blog post if people ask questions or other points occur to me.</p>

<p>Happy Christmas</p>

    <summary type="html">Extracting the Address details and the type of thing it actually is....</summary>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>I continued developing the parseXMl.php file to get 2 more sets of data. An address, which is a combination of <code>$housenumber . " " . $street . " " . $city . " " . $postcode;</code> and also a type, which is a combination of <code>sport, leisure, shop, amenity, office</code> which gives an idea of what the object is.</p>

<p>I have added fields into the database table to store these like so:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE `points` (
  `id` varchar(11) NOT NULL,
  `website` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `address` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `type` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `twitter` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `point` point NOT NULL,

  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  SPATIAL KEY `point` (`point`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB;

</code></pre>

<p>so now the parseXml.php file looks like this</p>

<h4><strong><code>parseXml.php</code></strong></h4>

<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php

$xmlDataString = file_get_contents('osmData.json');
$xmlObject = simplexml_load_string($xmlDataString);

$phpDataArray = json_decode($json, false ); 

foreach($phpDataArray as $value){
    foreach($value as $row){
        $name = "";
        $twitter = "";
        $housenumber = "";
        $street = "";
        $city = "";
        $postcode = "";
        $type = "";

        foreach($row-&gt;{'tag'} as $attributes){
            if($attributes-&gt;{'@attributes'}-&gt;{'k'} == 'name'){
                $name = ($attributes-&gt;{'@attributes'}-&gt;{'v'});
            }

            if($attributes-&gt;{'@attributes'}-&gt;{'k'} == 'contact:twitter'){
                $twitter = ($attributes-&gt;{'@attributes'}-&gt;{'v'});

            if($attributes-&gt;{'@attributes'}-&gt;{'k'} == 'addr:housenumber'){

                $city = ($attributes-&gt;{'@attributes'}-&gt;{'v'});

            if($attributes-&gt;{'@attributes'}-&gt;{'k'} == 'addr:postcode'){
                $postcode = ($attributes-&gt;{'@attributes'}-&gt;{'v'});

            if($attributes-&gt;{'@attributes'}-&gt;{'k'} == 'sport'){

            if($attributes-&gt;{'@attributes'}-&gt;{'k'} == 'leisure'){
                $type = ($attributes-&gt;{'@attributes'}-&gt;{'v'});
            }
            if($attributes-&gt;{'@attributes'}-&gt;{'k'} == 'shop'){
                $type = ($attributes-&gt;{'@attributes'}-&gt;{'v'});

            }
            if($attributes-&gt;{'@attributes'}-&gt;{'k'} == 'office'){
                $type = ($attributes-&gt;{'@attributes'}-&gt;{'v'});
            }

                $address = $housenumber . " " . $street . " " . $city . " " . $postcode;            
                $address = trim($address);

                // make the sql using INSERT IGNORE to prevent errors
                echo "INSERT IGNORE INTO `points` (`id`, `website`, `address`, `type` , `twitter`, `name`, `point`) ";
                echo "VALUES(" . $row-&gt;{'@attributes'}-&gt;id .", '" . addslashes($attributes-&gt;{'@attributes'}-&gt;{'v'}) . "', '". addslashes($address) . "', '". addslashes($type) .

                echo PHP_EOL;
            }
        }
    }
}

</code></pre>

<p>running it using the same 2 commands, the first processes the xml file and outputs sql inserts, the second inserts it into the db.</p>

<pre><code>php parseXml.php &gt; points1.sql
mysql -u root -p dbtable &lt; points1.sql
</code></pre>

<p>There are a few other fields I was looking at, including <code>facebook, contact:facebook, contact:instagram, contact:linkedin, linkedin, addr:country, email, phone, contact:phone</code> but these dont actually hold much data. So I am going to focus on displaying the results on the location pages to list the nearby entries.</p>

<p>NB: The <code>type</code> field in the code above only takes the value of the last field that exists so office is more important than amenity etc... I did notice that some have multiple values separated by semi-colons (eg. spinning;fitness;yoga) I will check to see if these work in the overpass api results.</p>

<p>I am also planning to run a web spider/crawler on these results to see which pages are working (non 404 results) and also extract more of the external social media links using my <a href="https://github.com/allotmentandy/SocialMediaLinkExtractor" target="_blank">Social Media Link Extractor package</a> but that is for a future post. I would be interested in adding this data to the overpass api automatically, but not sure that is allowed.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>Furthermore to the last blog, I updated the php script to output sql, created a new database table, imported it into the database and started to output the data.</p>

<p>Going to use the new(ish) point datatype in mysql.</p>

<pre><code class="language-mysql">CREATE TABLE `points` (
  `id` varchar(11) NOT NULL,
  `website` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `twitter` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `point` point NOT NULL,

  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  SPATIAL KEY `point` (`point`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB;

</code></pre>

<p>I amended the php script in yesterdays post to output sql.</p>

<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php

$xmlDataString = file_get_contents('osmData.xml');
$xmlObject = simplexml_load_string($xmlDataString);

$json = json_encode($xmlObject);
$phpDataArray = json_decode($json, false ); 

foreach($phpDataArray as $value){
    foreach($value as $row){
        $name = "";
        $twitter = "";

        foreach($row-&gt;{'tag'} as $attributes){
            if($attributes-&gt;{'@attributes'}-&gt;{'k'} == 'name'){
                $name = ($attributes-&gt;{'@attributes'}-&gt;{'v'});
            }

            if($attributes-&gt;{'@attributes'}-&gt;{'k'} == 'contact:twitter'){
                $twitter = ($attributes-&gt;{'@attributes'}-&gt;{'v'});
            }

            if($attributes-&gt;{'@attributes'}-&gt;{'k'} == 'website'){

                echo "INSERT INTO `points` (`id`, `website`, `twitter`, `name`, `point`) ";
                echo "VALUES(" . $row-&gt;{'@attributes'}-&gt;id .", '" . $attributes-&gt;{'@attributes'}-&gt;{'v'} . "', '". $twitter . "', '" . addslashes($name) . "', POINT(" . $row-&gt;{'@attributes'}-&gt;lat . " , " . $row-&gt;{'@attributes'}-&gt;lon ." ));"; 

                echo PHP_EOL;
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>To save the sql i ran</p>

<pre><code>php xmlParser.php &gt; points.sql
</code></pre>

<p>To import it to the database i run</p>

<pre><code>mysql -u root -p dbName &lt; points.sql
</code></pre>

<p>There was a couple of problems due to 2 urls having ' in them! Neither actually worked (404 errors) so i manually deleted them from the import table, deleted the table contents and started again. Third time lucky, i had a new db table with over 10,000 records.</p>

<p>Now i can run a query like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM points WHERE ST_Distance_Sphere(point, POINT(51.49591970845512, -0.26298522949218756)) &lt;= 2000 ;
</code></pre>

<p>which returns 100 websites within 2500 metres of the point (in chiswick)! This works for all the points i tried including much shorter coordinates.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM points WHERE ST_Distance_Sphere(point, POINT(51.49, -0.14)) &lt;= 2000 ;
</code></pre>

<p>Now I wanted to improve it further and show and order by  the distance from the centre point</p>

<pre><code>SELECT id, name, website,
  ST_X(point) AS longitude,
  ST_Y(point) AS latitude,
  ST_DISTANCE_SPHERE(point, POINT(51.49455119685909, -0.14415264129638675)) AS dist
FROM points 
HAVING dist &lt; 500
ORDER BY  dist;
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/assets/images/mysqlSelectDistance.png"></p>

<p>Now i am going to improve the import parser to add the addresses to make it easier to see problems.</p>

<p>Changing the <code>INSERT</code> command to <code>INSERT IGNORE</code> to ignore errors</p>

        <p>I extracted an XML dump from the <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/" target="_blank">overpass-api</a>.</p>

<p>My plan is to import this data to a database so I wrote a php script to convert this data from XML to Json and then output the data in the terminal.</p>

<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php

        }
    }
}

echo "total records with website: " . $counter . PHP_EOL;

</code></pre>

<p>Here is a sample of the output which shows entries that have a website url.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/sampleOSMdata.png"></p>

<p>The green values are the website values, the yellow the names and the blue ones the twitter fields. Some of the websites arnt websites, many dont have the http/https prefix. Some of the entries dont have names. The twitter links arnt in any standard format, full url, @twitterhandle or just the twitter handle.</p>

<p>I will develop this script further to extract more info from the xml and work out how and what to store in the database. Stay tuned.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>I recently relaunch <a href="http://www.londinium.com" target="_blank">londinium.com</a> with a number of the mapping features I have been working on.</p>

<p>The frontpage of <a href="http://www.londinium.com" target="_blank">londinium.com</a> now has a number of different styles of maps with links to airports and main stations alongside postcodes. 
You can access these in the top right corner menu. I have added all the mapbox ones, but there are a lot more.</p>

<p>This is on top of showing the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features" target="_blank">Openstreetmap tags / map features</a> (eg, supermarkets)</p>

<p>The features are extracted using <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/" target="_blank">overpass-api</a> which is an frontend for the data held in the OSM system.</p>

<p>It is built using <a href="http://www.laravel.com" target="_blank">laravel</a> which is the php framework i have used most over the past few years</p>

<p>The maps use <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">leaflet js</a>. You can see the range of base maps available on <a href="http://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/index.html" target="_blank">http://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/index.html</a></p>

<h3>Useful Leaflet JS links</h3>

<p>Here are a number of links i found useful in developing the website.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tomik23/leaflet-examples" target="_blank">tomik23/leaflet-examples</a></p>

<p><a href="http://harrywood.co.uk/maps/examples/" target="_blank">Harry Wood map examples</a></p>

<p><a href="https://devdocs.io/leaflet~1.7/index#popup" target="_blank">Devdocs LeafletJS</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/plepe/overpass-layer" target="_blank">github.com/plepe/overpass-layer</a></p>

<h3>Ideas and notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>The current site uses the data from overpass turbo, and can be a bit slow to load. Also it times out sometimes. Interested in hosting this locally.</li>
<li>Also would like to add a <em>loading</em> message to show the data is loading. If it fails, perhaps it could show an error message</li>
<li>There is some inconsistency with the data in the OSM system. For example, there most twitter links include the full url, whilst others are @twitter links and others are just the twitter account. Need to address this in someway.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>This morning I got an alert from Amazon that said I was at 85% usage for storage on my free tier account. I thought this was odd, as I had been trying to stay within the free limits. Looking at the Instance console, it had a 50gb storage disk, which is higher than the 30gb allowed in the free tier. No problem.</p>

<p>A simple change of <a href="https://github.com/allotmentandy/aws/blob/dd8728f63361e9c537037eaccee32858c7770a16/Part%204%20-%20using%20terraform%20to%20create%20an%20EC2%20instance/setup.tf#L67">line 67 of the setup.tf file</a> from 50gb to 29gb and then by running 2 commands, quickly, an instance is back up with a smaller disk!</p>

<pre><code>terraform destroy

terraform apply
</code></pre>

<p>This is devops! Fast, accurate automation to solve problems and get up and running accurately.</p>

<p>On my journey learning and using the AWS Cloud, I have been looking at more of the offerings from Amazon.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>AWS Elastic Beanstalk</strong> is an orchestration service offered from Amazon Web Services for deploying infrastructure which orchestrates various AWS services, including EC2, S3, Simple Notification Service, CloudWatch, autoscaling, and Elastic Load Balancers.</li>
<li><strong>AWS Lambda</strong> is a serverless, event-driven compute service that lets you run code for virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers. You can trigger Lambda from over 200 AWS services and software as a service (SaaS) applications, and only pay for what you use.</li>
</ul>

        <p>Having setup the docker image and got it working on the EC2 instance, I wanted to improve the laravel website within the Docker image.</p>

<p>Installing tailwind into the laraveldocker app i made in Part 5 following this tutorial <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/laravel">https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/laravel</a></p>

<pre><code>npm install

npm install -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest

npx tailwindcss init

</code></pre>

<p>setting up the tailwind config and the webpack config to allow</p>

<pre><code>npm run dev
</code></pre>

<p>adding the css to the html in /resources/views/welcome.blade.php and hey presto tailwind css is working.</p>

        <p>Next in this series, I am setting up a docker container to host a laravel website on AWS.</p>

<p>Following this tutorial <a href="https://buddy.works/guides/laravel-in-docker">https://buddy.works/guides/laravel-in-docker</a></p>

<p>I started with a fresh install of Laravel 8 which is in Part 5 of the repo <a href="https://github.com/allotmentandy/aws">github.com/allotmentandy/aws</a> with this Dockerfile</p>

<pre><code>FROM php:8.0.5
RUN apt-get update -y &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y openssl zip unzip git
RUN curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
RUN docker-php-ext-install pdo 
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN composer install

CMD php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8888
EXPOSE 8888
</code></pre>

<h3>BUILD the container</h3>

<pre><code>docker build -t laravelDocker .
</code></pre>

<h3>RUN the container</h3>

<pre><code>docker run -p 8888:8888 laravelDocker
</code></pre>

<h3>STOP the container</h3>

<p>The first command shows all the containers, the second stops the container with the id</p>

<pre><code>docker container ls

docker container stop ba0ce2c7575f
</code></pre>

<p>visiting http://localhost:8888/  see the laravel frontpage</p>

<p>I am  going to set it up on an EC2 server instance, but that doesnt seem the norm with Lightsail, Lambda or ECS seemingly better fits for hosting a container image.</p>

<p>So i have the Debian Instance i setup in part 4 with Terraform, now i am going to manually login via ssh, and setup docker</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg2 software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce
</code></pre>

<p>Now i need to add my docker container to <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/allotmentandy/laraveldocker">docker hub</a></p>

<pre><code>docker ps # to see the docker images eg. id = 5a6a73bcea26

# docker commit -m "first commit" -a "NAME" laraveldocker allotmentandy/laraveldocker:latest # didnt work :(

docker login

docker tag 5a6a73bcea26 allotmentandy/laraveldocker

docker push allotmentandy/laraveldocker
</code></pre>

<p>Et voila! <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/allotmentandy/laraveldocker">dockerhub / allotmentandy</a></p>

<p>now i ssh into the EC2 instance</p>

<pre><code>docker pull allotmentandy/laraveldocker
sudo docker run -p 80:80 allotmentandy/laraveldocker

</code></pre>

<p>updating the laravel files / dockerfile means a rebuild:</p>

<pre><code>docker build -t allotmentandy/laraveldocker -f Dockerfile  .
docker push allotmentandy/laraveldocker

</code></pre>

<p>stopping the container, redoing the pull and running it again. Simples :)</p>

<p>Please visit this repo at <a href="https://github.com/allotmentandy/aws">github.com/allotmentandy/aws</a> to see the terraform code in the directory part 4. The code is in the setup.tf file and the get it to build the instance you run the following 3 commands.</p>

<pre><code>terraform init 

terraform plan

terraform apply
</code></pre>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The ip address is allocated to my account and it id = "eipalloc-07a144e8268e6616b"</p></li>
<li><p>The keyname is the name in the amazon system, not the local file.</p></li>
<li><p>The aws credentials are setup using awscli at the command line and stored in .aws/credentials</p></li>

    <summary type="html">Using Ansible to setup the LAMP stack on a clean Debian AWS server....</summary>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>In parts 1 and 2 of this blog series, I wrote about setting up a LAMP stack by hand using ssh and logging into the server and install and configuring it all.</p>

<p>In my opinion, <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html">Ansible</a> is a better way to set this up. It uses a set of files locally to login to and setup the server in a repeatable way.</p>

<p>Once again I am going to use the Debian 10 AMI - ami-050949f5d3aede071 setup with a t2-micro instance on the free tier.</p>

<p>Please visit this repo at <a href="https://github.com/allotmentandy/aws">github.com/allotmentandy/aws</a> for the Ansible files to set this up.</p>

<p>I based this on <a href="https://github.com/kdpuvvadi/ansible-lamp">github.com/kdpuvvadi/ansible-lamp</a> repo as it worked well and is nicely structured.</p>

<p>Important files to setup</p>

<ul>
<li>inventory.ini - set the ip address of the aws debian server</li>
<li>vars/default.yml - set the passwords for the mysql root user, the name of the apache config and the port</li>
<li>tasks/packages - the packages to install, php, mysql, apache and ufw</li>
<li>README.md - notes on setting up the original ansible package.</li>
</ul>

<p>To run this code use this command where the key is set in the command</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">  ansible-playbook main.yml --key-file /home/andy/.ssh/aws2021.pem  -e 'ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3'
</code></pre>

<p>visit the ip address to see the apache test page. /info.php to see the php test page. and login to the mysql server to test the database connection.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <h3>Adding the Mysql DB and getting it running</h3>

<p>Installing mysql isnt as simple as the rest of the LAMP stack. It is necessary to run the mysql_secure_installation command to setup the mysql password and the Update command to allowed login from the website for apps like Adminer. <a href="https://dev.to/oscherler/changing-the-mysql-root-user-from-authsocket-to-password-authentication-using-ansible-3l5m">this article</a> is a good explaination to why.</p>

<pre><code># install mysql

sudo apt-get install -y default-mysql-server
sudo apt-get install -y php8.0-mysql php8.1-mysql

#set the password and setup mysql
sudo mysql_secure_installation

# questions asked
# Enter current password for root (enter for none): 
# Set root password? [Y/n] Y
# Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] Y   
# Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] Y
# Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] Y
# Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] Y

#test connection with the new password 
sudo mysql -u root -p

# to allow login for adminer login to mysql and run
# UPDATE user SET plugin='mysql_native_password' WHERE User='root';

# install adminer
sudo wget "http://www.adminer.org/latest.php" -O /var/www/html/adminer.php
sudo chown -R root:root /var/www/html/adminer.php
sudo chmod 755 /var/www/html/adminer.php

sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart

</code></pre>

<p>This allows the user to login from the website using adminer and administer the DB tables.</p>

        <h3>AWS Amazon Web Services Cloud computing and PHP</h3>

<p>I my quest to learn more about cloud computing especially using PHP, I am spending the cold winter months developing skills. I am going to write blogs about investigating each of these</p>

<ul>
<li>EC2 Debian 10 LAMP server by hand</li>
<li>EC2 Docker Container</li>
<li>AWS Lambda</li>
<li>Amazon Lightsail</li>
<li>Using ansible and terraform to setup a lamp server</li>
<li>Using the AWS CLI</li>
</ul>

<h4>Using EC2 Debian 10 LAMP stack server by hand.</h4>

<p>Setting up an instance is pretty easy - i created a private key, downloaded it and connected the first time using</p>

<pre><code>ssh -i privatekey.pem  admin@ec2-13-40-50-116.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
</code></pre>

<p>Note the user is admin, as that is the default for debian</p>

<p>Here is a link to the default usernames for different systems</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesConnecting.html#TroubleshootingInstancesConnectingPuTTY">aws default users for ssh connections to linux distros</a></p>

<p>To run apt-get you need to use sudo</p>

<p>So to install apache</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

sudo apt-get install apache2

sudo a2enmod ssl
sudo a2enmod rewrite
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

# install firewall and setup

sudo apt install ufw
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw allow http
sudo ufw allow https

# to get the https version running

sudo apt install certbot
sudo apt-get install python-certbot-apache

sudo a2ensite default-ssl

sudo systemctl reload apache2

# installing php 8.0 and 8.1

sudo apt-get install lsb-release apt-transport-https ca-certificates
sudo wget -O /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/php.gpg https://packages.sury.org/php/apt.gpg
sudo echo "deb https://packages.sury.org/php/ $(lsb_release -sc) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt install -y php8.0-{mysql,cli,common,snmp,ldap,curl,mbstring,zip,tidy,xml,opcache}
sudo apt install -y php8.1-{mysql,cli,common,snmp,ldap,curl,mbstring,zip,tidy,xml,opcache}

sudo update-alternatives --config php

sudo apt-get install php8.0-fpm libapache2-mod-php8.0
sudo apt-get install php8.1-fpm libapache2-mod-php8.1
sudo a2dismod php8.0
sudo a2enmod php8.1
sudo systemctl restart apache2

</code></pre>

<p>The default directory for the files is /var/www/html
Setting up a simple test.php file with the contents</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

phpinfo();
</code></pre>

<p>Gives the php info test page.</p>

<p>Next, lets install a mysql database to store some data.</p>

<p>Please visit this repo at <a href="https://github.com/allotmentandy/aws">github.com/allotmentandy/aws</a> for shell scripts and files to run this code.</p>

        <p>I wanted to right a new post about the sort of job role I am looking for. In the past I have had a wide variety of roles from Creative Graphic Designer to Laravel Developer. So I wanted to outline the sort of roles I would be suitable for and to help find a role thats uses a number of these:</p>

<ul>
<li>Laravel PHP development</li>
<li>Web Design with CSS, Photos, Graphics and Imagery</li>
<li>SEO to get the site higher in Search Engines such as Google</li>
<li>Devops and Server configuration using Ansible, Terraform on Google Cloud (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS)</li>
<li>Creative Ideas to improve the business</li>
<li>Writing content for blogs and websites</li>
<li>Using Mapping technologies such as OpenStreetMap</li>
<li>Testing websites and code using a range of tools to ensure websites work as expected</li>
<li>Web Scraping, crawling and indexing content from across the internet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some example jobs I would be good at</p>

<h3>Moving CSS to Tailwind CSS</h3>

<p>This site and a number of others I have been working on use Tailwind CSS and I would like to find a role to teleport an old fashioned website into the future.</p>

<h3>Writing content for SEO purposes</h3>

<p>I enjoy writing on a number of topics including technology, gardening, cooking and aviation. Perhaps you need some articles written about something</p>

<h3>Scripting to automate your life</h3>

<p>Another skill I have is writing scripts (bash, php etc.) to automate regular processes in your day-to-day work process. Instead of doing it by hand, perhaps i could write you a script to do it automatically</p>

<h3>Mapping projects</h3>

<p>I have recently been working on a mapping project using OpenStreetMap and have used Google Maps extensively in the past.</p>

<p>This is just a short idea of projects I could do for you.</p>

        <p>Having spent the last year improving my skill base in the Devops arena, I feel like I have gone full circle with Packer. Packer is a tool from Hashicorp that creates server images which you can host on the cloud.</p>

<p>I have learnt to configure the cloud with terraform, then setup the tech stack with Ansible.</p>

<p>I have also learnt to Dockerise the entire system as a container</p>

<p>But creating Packer images seems like the most efficient method to build servers with all the tools above, which is then deployed as an image. I can still use Ansible to config it, with terraform to launch it.</p>

        <p>To connect my new Intel NUC computer to my laptop and android phone, I have used SSH with Filezilla as that is faster and easier than bluetooth and more ubiqitous. On my phone i have an app which i use to start and stop the ssh port connection. But not sure this is as easy on the Debian boxes, so...</p>

<p>Firstly, i wanted to check what ports were open on the machine. <a href="https://vitux.com/find-open-ports-on-debian/" target="_blank">https://vitux.com/find-open-ports-on-debian/</a> gives a overview of the options, but installing nmap is my favourite tool for this and running this command gives the output of all open ports.</p>

<pre><code>apt-get install nmap

nmap -p- 127.0.0.1

</code></pre>

<p>Nmap provides the name of the commonly used port as the 'service', port 22 is ssh and it wasnt installed.</p>

<pre><code>Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-06-15 09:18 BST
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.000058s latency).
Not shown: 65533 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
631/tcp  open  ipp
1716/tcp open  xmsg

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 10.15 seconds
</code></pre>

<h3>Installing SSH</h3>

<p>Next, to install ssh I ran this command</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install openssh-server
</code></pre>

<p>then to check on the status</p>

<pre><code>sudo systemctl status sshd
</code></pre>

<p>This allowed me to ssh into my machine and copy over a few files. Running the nmap command again and you can see it is now working.</p>

<pre><code>Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-06-15 09:35 BST
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.000031s latency).
Not shown: 65532 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
631/tcp  open  ipp
1716/tcp open  xmsg

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 10.12 seconds
</code></pre>

<p>to enable / disable ssh i run these commands</p>

<pre><code>systemctl enable ssh
systemctl disable ssh
</code></pre>

<p>Next, I will use Ansible to install Apache, PHP, Mysql/MariaDB and more tools ...</p>

        <h3>Downloading the data for features in Greater London</h3>

<p>Yesterday, I uploaded the demo map and got a buggy version of the OSM map working showing the data stored on a map. I wanted to explore what is actually stored in the system already so I got this query to extract multiple tags (website, twitter, facebook) in one <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/" target="_blank">overpass-turbo</a> query.</p>

<pre><code>node[~"^(website|twitter|facebook)$"~"."]  ({{bbox}});
out;
</code></pre>

<p>This file was exported as .geojson and I then wrote a php script to extract those 3 elements and count them. using <a href="https://github.com/halaxa/json-machine" target="_blank">json machine</a></p>

<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
use \JsonMachine\JsonMachine;

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$counter = 0;
$features = JsonMachine::fromFile('websiteTwitterFacebook.geojson');

foreach ($features as $key=&gt;$value) {
    if ($key=="features"){
        foreach ($value as $feature){
            echo $feature['properties']['@id'];
            echo " ";
            if(isset($feature['properties']['website'])) {
                echo $feature['properties']['website'];
            }
            echo " ";
            if(isset($feature['properties']['twitter'])) {
                echo $feature['properties']['twitter'];
            }
            echo " ";
            if(isset($feature['properties']['facebook'])) {
                echo $feature['properties']['facebook'];
            }
            echo PHP_EOL;
            $counter++;
        }
    }
}
echo "total: ". $counter;
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Total entries with any of the three elements was around 16,000, mainly with websites entries only. This data included some phone numbers and other things:</p>

<pre><code>+44 20 3912 9400
+44 20 7584 1363
+44 20 7584 8918

        <p>I am looking at re-launching my <strong>London</strong> website using Openstreetmap with overpass data.</p>

<p><a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features" target="_blank">Openstreetmap tags / map features</a></p>

<p>I have created a <a href="/overpassMap" target="_blank">demo page</a> to show the map features from the list above. Try entering these in the search box on the <a href="/overpassMap" target="_blank">demo page</a></p>

<ul>
<li>shop=butchers</li>
<li>landuse=allotments</li>
<li>amenity=restaurant</li>
<li>sport=soccer</li>
<li>highway=bus_stop</li>
<li>name=Morrisons</li>
<li>shop</li>
<li>twitter</li>
<li>facebook</li>
<li>website</li>
</ul>

<p>What I would like to do is create 2 subpage templates which pull the query from the url</p>

<ul>
<li>local area eg. Chiswick  /location/chiswick</li>
<li>features eg. Butchers /shop/butchers</li>
</ul>

<p>At first i would like to start with a simple site, but structure it, so it is easy to add features in the future.</p>

<p>I had Laravel in mind as I am used to developing with that, but not sure the best way to get this mapping included.</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<ol>
<li>What mapping framework would you use to build this? I have looked into Leaflet.js for this demo.</li>
<li>Is there an easy way to output all tags that apply to the UK? eg. aerialway=t-bar isnt really relevant as there are no ski-resorts in London</li>
<li>How can I update the details for each business? whats the best way to get involved with the data here.</li>
<li>What is the difference between tags and map features. I wanted to show a friend an asian supermarket in hammersmith called <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=hammersmith#map=19/51.49335/-0.23940" target="_blank">Thai Smile</a> - was wondering what is the tags/info for this place. Is this all the data that is stored for <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/313617786">Thai Smile</a></li>
<li>I would like to see a map with all the tags / map features and ALL data for an area to see what is available. Would this be easier to do offline / locally?</li>
<li>Can I use tags on the <a href="/overpassMap" target="_blank">demo page</a> map?</li>
<li>What are the best tools i can easily install on debian linux? I installed <strong>merkaartor</strong> a map editor for OpenStreetMap.org, and this allowed me to see the data stored for each entry. But where is this info actually visible on a map? There are shops that say they have a bing:photograph, but where is this visible? This is the data I would like to access and use. I would also update it too if I can use this how I hope I can.</li>
</ol>

    <summary type="html">Upgrading PHP to version 8 to run Laravel Octane and test sites locally for compatability....</summary>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>With the launch of Laravel Octane, I decided it was time to update to PHP 8 on my debian box. This was the process, compiled from a number of webpages which seemed to have cut and paste the wget line wrongly. The php extensions are those needed for Laravel.</p>

<p>update-alternatives is a lovely little tool to select which php version to use.</p>

<pre><code>    apt-get install lsb-release apt-transport-https ca-certificates
    wget -O /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/php.gpg https://packages.sury.org/php/apt.gpg
    echo "deb https://packages.sury.org/php/ $(lsb_release -sc) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list
    apt-get update
    apt-cache search php 8
    apt install -y php8.0-{mysql,cli,common,snmp,ldap,curl,mbstring,zip,tidy,xml,opcache}
    update-alternatives --config php
    php -v
</code></pre>

<p>However, this only worked at the command line, to get apache to work with php8.0 i also ran</p>

<pre><code>    apt-get install php8.0-fpm libapache2-mod-php8.0
    a2dismod php7.4
    a2enmod php8.0
    systemctl restart apache2
</code></pre>

<p>and viola! the phpinfo() was now version 8.0.3!</p>

<p>However, a tested a Laravel 5 app and it errored with a blank screen. So had to update composer to version 2 and run a composer upgrade like so</p>

<pre><code>    composer self-update --2
    composer upgrade 
</code></pre>

<p>What an improvement in speed for composer! I had to update these lines in the composer json to</p>

<pre><code>        "php": "^7.4|^8.0",
        "fzaninotto/faker": "^1.9.1",
        "phpunit/phpunit": "^9.3"    
</code></pre>

<p>I still have a laravel 5.5 app that i like to use, to downgrade back to php7.4</p>

<pre><code>a2dismod php8.0
a2enmod php7.4
systemctl restart apache2
</code></pre>

<p>and to re-enable php 8.0</p>

<pre><code>a2enmod php8.0
a2dismod php7.4
systemctl restart apache2
</code></pre>

<p>But there is a better way, edit the apache2-site-74.conf and add this to the virtual host conf</p>

<pre><code>        &lt;FilesMatch \.php$&gt;
                # Apache 2.4.10+ can proxy to unix socket
                SetHandler "proxy:unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock|fcgi://localhost/"
        &lt;/FilesMatch&gt;

</code></pre>

<p>and enable the proxy module</p>

<pre><code>a2enmod proxy_fcgi
systemctl restart apache2
</code></pre>

<p>and viola! both versions work, php8 is the default, with php7.4 enabled for the site.</p>

<p>Perfect!</p>

        <p>I like to keep my Debian Linux machine clean and up-to-date. I regularly run the update to get the latest versions and security patches. (I have disabled the default auto-update as it open happened when i was on a limited interenet connection)</p>

<p>After running</p>

<pre><code>apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
OR
apt-get dist-upgrade
</code></pre>

<p>Regularly find that a lot of files are left behind. So i started a script to cleanup afterwards.</p>

<pre><code>apt-get clean
apt-get autoclean
apt-get autoremove
apt-get purge
</code></pre>

<p>using docker, there is also space to reclain using (WARNING: adding the -a at the end deletes all of them!)</p>

<pre><code>docker system prune 
</code></pre>

<p>Interested to hear from everyone about how else they clean up space after installing and upgrading their computers...</p>

<p>One problem i found was the max_user_watches was set too low, so running the following command as root, increases the number of file nodes this is allowed to watch. And it worked perfectly after that.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">    echo 100000 | tee /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches
</code></pre>

<p>Another problem i found is that it breaks if you rename a file, as it monitors for changes, but it cannot deal with that.</p>

<p>This is my build.sh script. It runs the local build but can also run with these flags too:</p>

<pre><code>--npm           runs the laravel mix webpack build
--production    generates the production build
</code></pre>

<p>It uses espeak to announce it is building (a bit like command and conquer!) and then xdotool to reload the firefox browser.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">#!/bin/bash -e

# espeak "Building"

for arg in "$@"
do
    if [ "$arg" == "--npm" ] 
    then
        echo "Running npm run production"
        espeak " running en pee em "
        npm run production
    fi
done

espeak "building Local"

 ./vendor/bin/jigsaw -vvv build 

for arg in "$@"
do
    if [ "$arg" == "--production" ] 
    then
        espeak "building production"
        ./vendor/bin/jigsaw build production -vvv
    fi
done

espeak "Finished"

# reload firefox in background
CURRENT_WID=$(xdotool getwindowfocus)
WID=$(xdotool search --name "Mozilla Firefox")
xdotool windowactivate $WID
xdotool key F5
# return to the editor (i prefer it to keep the browser at the front so comment this out!)
xdotool windowactivate $CURRENT_WID

</code></pre>

        <p>The original version of Tailwind CSS used jigsaw for the docs, the same project i use for this blog, which was lovely. However the latest version (2.0.3 at the time of writing) has migrated to next.js so it was time to investigate and install.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com">github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com</a></p>

<p>I prefer to have apache serve all my pages locally, so i followed the instructions adding a</p>

<p><code>yarnpkg export</code></p>

<p>to create an html static site of the documentation into an 'out' directory which apache can serve, which all worked well (if a little slow to generate it all). But it all works locally, which i like.</p>

<h3>Awesome TailwindCSS</h3>

<p>As the Tailwind CSS project has grown and matured, a great <a href="https://github.com/aniftyco/awesome-tailwindcss">Awesome TailwindCSS</a> github page has grown and grown.</p>

    <summary type="html">my first article in a series on Ansible, covering the Facts ansible can tell you about your machines and how I have been learning Ansible....</summary>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>Of all the Devops tools I have learnt this year, Ansible is my favourite. The ability to connect to different servers and perform different tasks in a way you can expect is superb. I have installed different flavour Linux Virtual Machines alongside my Raspberry Pi's and it connects to each one and does its thing as I expect.</p>

<p>The idea of automating everything, having it act in an expected and repeatable way is superb. I have written bash scripts that try to do this in the past, but fall over at scale and repeatability. Ansible is great for this.</p>

<p>In the process of learning ansible I have an inventory with 1 control node and 4 machines</p>

<pre><code>[x] localhost (debian 10) [Control node]
[x] virtual machine (centos 8)
[x] virtual machine (ubuntu 20)
[x] virtual machine (alpine linux 3.12)
[x] raspberry pi (raspbian)
</code></pre>

<p>With this as my personal cloud, i can connect with ansible via ssh and run a whole range of tasks including:</p>

<pre><code>[x] install and configure a webserver, mysql and install a laravel github repo
[x] run a git pull to update the repo
[x] update the OS and software
[x] install a docker container on a server 
[x] check the status of the machines 
</code></pre>

<p>Ansible provides a number of Facts for a machine which can be seen with this command:</p>

<pre><code>ansible localhost -m setup --tree /tmp/facts
</code></pre>

<p>it is a json file of around 600 lines of Facts including for my localhost machine:</p>

<pre><code>    "ansible_facts":
    {
        "ansible_os_family": "Debian",
        "ansible_architecture": "x86_64",
        "ansible_memtotal_mb": 7417,

    }
</code></pre>

<p>There is also extensive details about hardrives, IP addresses, python versions, users and the computer in general.</p>

<p>Similarly, Ansible provides details of the services running on the machine:</p>

<pre><code>ansible localhost -m service_facts --tree /tmp/services
</code></pre>

<p>it provides a 1000 line Json file, with details of the services running on the machine, here is an example of the result:</p>

<pre><code>    "ansible_facts":
    {
        "services":
            "apache2":
            {
                "name": "apache2",
                "source": "sysv",
                "state": "running"
            },
            "apache2.service":
            {
                "name": "apache2.service",
                "source": "systemd",
                "state": "running",
                "status": "enabled"
            },
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Also available is a list of package facts</p>

<pre><code>ansible localhost -m package_facts --tree /tmp/package
</code></pre>

<p>This resulted in a json file with over 20000 lines, with details of everything installed on the machine, here is a section from the result:</p>

<pre><code>    "ansible_facts":
    {
        "packages":
        {
            "apache2": [
            {
                "arch": "amd64",
                "category": "httpd",
                "name": "apache2",
                "origin": "Debian",
                "source": "apt",
                "version": "2.4.46-1"
            }],
            "zeal": [
            {
                "arch": "amd64",
                "category": "doc",
                "name": "zeal",
                "origin": "",
                "source": "apt",
                "version": "1:0.6.1-1+b1"
            }],
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This provides a great deal of info about the machine, from which you could manage the the machines with conditionals like this.</p>

<pre><code>- hosts: localhost
  roles:
     - role: debian_stock_config
       when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == 'Debian'
</code></pre>

<p>One thing I really like about Ansible is it is pretty obvious what the code is doing, and logical in how it does it. All these commands in this first part are ad-hoc, as in they are single commands you run in the command line.</p>

        <p>A lot of the time I work offline, learning, reading, watching and playing to learn more and more.</p>

<p>One thing i really like to use is offline tools to help me access info offline. However I am looking for info on a wide range of topics including devops, webdev, frontend, backend and linux in general. There is no one super tool which covers everything so here is a list of my favourite souces.</p>

<h3>man</h3>

<p>The <code>man</code> command provides a great starting point to read the manpages for a command. eg. <code>man ansible</code> gives a good intro, but it isnt the most readable or user friendly.</p>

<h3>apropos</h3>

<p>Finding what <code>man apropos</code> pages are available is possible with <code>apropos ansible</code></p>

<h3>gman</h3>

<p>Alongside the command line tools above, <code>gman</code> is a neat GUI tool to show an index of the man pages on the system.</p>

<h3>tldr</h3>

<p>tldr is similar to the man pages above, but gives examples of usage. <code>tldr git</code> or <code>tldr ansible</code> all provide a neat list of the most common commands you want to use. You have to update the database of info with the <code>tldr --update</code> command</p>

<h3>eg</h3>

<p>In a similar vain to tldr above, eg, provides even more examples of how to use a command, with a bit more detail.</p>

<h3>Zeal</h3>

<p>Zeal is a GUI which allows one to download docs to read offline. It doesnt cover as much, for example it has the docs for Ansible, Docker and Laravel, but not Terraform</p>

<h3>devdocs.io</h3>

<p>devdocs.io is an offline website which allows you to download the docs to read offline. It does cover Terraform, Ansible, Laravel and more. I use it with Chrome with a plugin</p>

<hr />

<p>I would be interested in anymore tools people use for offline documentation, especially one that covers Tailwind CSS.</p>

        <p>I was recently looking for videos to help me improve my bash terminal skills and found this video by Marie-Helene Burle <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFKT7aj-i80" target="_blank">Fun tools to simplify your life in the command line</a></p>

<p>The two tools i really liked and have found really useful are <code>fzf</code> and <code>ranger</code>.</p>

<h3>fzf</h3>

<p>fzf is a fuzzy search for the terminal. To search for docs in the directory which contain ansible  run <code>ls | fzf</code> and i can type ansible and it shows the files that contain ansible.</p>

<p>To search for ansible only use:</p>

<pre><code>ls | fzf -e -q "ansible"
</code></pre>

<h3>ranger</h3>

<p><code>ranger</code> is a terminal file manager that is nice and quick and lets me navigate and view the file content.</p>

<p>both of these tools can be installed with</p>

<pre><code>apt-get install fzf ranger
</code></pre>

<p>I am always on the lookout for more tools that improve and speed up the workflow.</p>

        <p>Having spent the summer learning more of the Devops toolkit, I often come back to bash shell scripts to achieve something.</p>

<h3>importEnv.sh</h3>

<p>I wanted a little script to import the values of the .env file to use in the bash scripts. This works as i expect.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">#!/bin/bash

source /var/www/laravel/.env
echo $DB_USERNAME
</code></pre>

<h3>mysqlBackup</h3>

<p>This is a one liner to backup all the mysql databases.</p>

<pre><code>mysql -u root -p -N -e 'show databases' | while read dbname; do mysqldump -u root -p --complete-insert --routines --triggers --single-transaction "$dbname" &gt; "$dbname".sql; done

</code></pre>

<h3>deploy.sh</h3>

<p>Working with the jigsaw static site builder, i wrote this simple script to copy the production version of the site to another directory and deploy it to the github pages site.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">#!/bin/bash -e

echo "Deploying build_production to allotmentandy.github.io"
echo "---------"

cd build_production 
cp -r * /var/www/allotmentandy.github.io

cd /var/www/allotmentandy.github.io

git add .
git commit -m "update"
git push

echo 'finished'
</code></pre>

<h3>clearLaravelCaches.sh</h3>

<pre><code class="language-bash">#!/bin/bash

echo "This a bash script to run composer clear the caches)"
echo "--------------"
php -v
#echo "--------------"

cd /var/www/laravel

php artisan down

composer dump-autoload -o

php artisan view:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan clear-compiled
php artisan config:cache
php artisan optimize

php artisan up

        <p>In my last contract role, I spent more time working with the Devops team than the frontend team. I really enjoyed it and now feel that this is a better path for me. I have been using the command line to build, manage and test servers for many many years and feel this is somewhere I can offer more to companies in the future.</p>

<p>I was on twitter and I found this article <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/alternative-career-paths/">about alternative career paths from freecodecamp</a> and the Devops idea was one most appealing to me.</p>

<p>I have spent a lot of the last few months learning more and more about linux and the Command line. Including learning Bash Scripting and Python.</p>

<h3>ssh</h3>

<p>create a ssh key and copy it to the raspberry pi:</p>

<pre><code>root@linuxtechi:~# ssh-keygen
root@linuxtechi:~# ssh-copy-id root@192.168.1.156
</code></pre>

<p>This allows you to ssh into the machine without a password.</p>

<h3>Bash Cheat sheet</h3>

<p>Back in the days as an Apple Mac user, i really like Applescript. With these little scripts you could get stuff done quickly and easily. Laravel also provides a need way to write command line scripts which allow me to download and process the data.</p>

<p>Bash scripting is similar, i now have scripts to create new posts for this blog, build the css/js with webpack, deploy the site to github and many more.</p>

<p>To help, I have added a <a href="/bash_shortcuts">Bash Cheat cheet</a> to this blog.</p>

<h3>Ansible</h3>

<p>Ansible is a tool to software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible_(software)">wikipedia</a></p>

<p><a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-ansible">opensource.com intro to ansible</a></p>

<p>I do like learning from videos and I found this series of videos 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2_OBreMn7FplshFCWYlaN2uS8et9RjNG">Ansible with Jeff Geerling</a></p>

<p>Cheatsheets</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/germainlefebvre4/ansible-cheatsheet">github.com/germainlefebvre4/ansible-cheatsheet</a></p>

<p><a href="https://armoucar.github.io/ansible-cheatsheet/">armoucar.github.io/ansible-cheatsheet/</a></p>

<p>Now i can setup a hosts file like so:</p>

<pre><code>[raspberrypi]
192.168.1.166 ansible_ssh_user=pi hostname=raspberrypi

</code></pre>

<p>Once i set up the ssh login (see above), i can now test the server connection with</p>

<pre><code>ansible -i hosts -m ping raspberrypi
</code></pre>

<p>i have setup a new github repo which i run like this:</p>

<pre><code>ansible-playbook site.yml -i hosts
</code></pre>

<h3>Vagrant and Virtualbox</h3>

<p>With Laravel there is Homestead which provides an easy vagrant box with all the linux tools to run a website. I have also used Virtualbox for years to run debian boxes from around the time of Debian 6.</p>

<pre><code>vagrant up
vagrant halt
vagrant ssh
</code></pre>

<h3>Docker</h3>

<p>Docker takes the whole Vagrant VM forward and makes an entire container which you can deploy as the finished website. I have used it before in my last contract role and found it very powerful.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvDXzyOP3NE">Kickass Laravel Development with Docker - David McKay - Laracon EU 2018 Amsterdam</a></p>

<h3>Jenkins</h3>

<p>Jenkins is a Continuous Integration and testing environment which allows you to test your code as it is pushed to Github.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuBD3p20oyE">PHP UK Conference 2018 - Michael Heap - Zero to Jenkins: Automatic builds + deploys
</a></p>

<p>I am installing Jenkins on my Raspberry Pi using this tutorial from 
<a href="https://pimylifeup.com/jenkins-raspberry-pi/">https://pimylifeup.com/jenkins-raspberry-pi/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://jenkins-php.org/installation.html">jenkins-php.org</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/amochohan/laravel-jenkins-ci-boilerplate">https://github.com/amochohan/laravel-jenkins-ci-boilerplate</a></p>

<p>To install jenkins add this to the playbook</p>

<pre><code>   tasks:
    - name: ensure the jenkins apt repository key is installed
      apt_key: url=https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key state=present
      become: yes

    - name: ensure the repository is configured
      apt_repository: repo='deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/' state=present
      become: yes

    - name: ensure jenkins is installed
      apt: name=jenkins update_cache=yes
      become: yes

    - name: ensure jenkins is running
      service: name=jenkins state=started

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>I have been trying a number of new things to try and get work.</p>

<p>Firstly i discovered <a href="http://www.nextdoor.co.uk">nextdoor.co.uk</a> a localised website for helping people communicate with each other. The site excited me at first and I managed to post a number of messages about potential jobs/work. The first one about IT work got one response, I elderly gentleman who wanted help 'in the future' with setting up a laptop, security and more. However, he has never got back to me and I dont hold out much hope that he will. The second post was offering gardening work, something I can do and enjoy. This too had one response, from a lady nearby. I wondered round, to find a tiny garden, but alas the women had no money to pay for the work and was just trying to get me to do it as a portfolio piece. Hmm. Further posts have gotten me nowhere except I guy that asked for a day or twos labour, and then cancelled the day before as his cousin was coming and would do it for free. Great.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I emailed / contacted around 10 local gardening firms about gardening work and have got zero replies. Great.</p>

<p>Yesterday I also looked at finding potential work on <a href="https://www.upwork.com">Upwork.com</a> A website for freelancers and companies to content for work. I have used this website before and also elance which they have taken over in the past. I preferred elance as it worked better without all the fancy javascript which doesn't quite work. Now though, Upwork has created a type of currency called 'connects' which you have to buy for the right to connect with potential jobs. I have used this site to hire programmers in the past, and the spam was very high.</p>

<p>So still trying to find work, any ideas?</p>

        <p>Yesterday i wrote about how i was looking at wordpress and laravel starter projects to build a website directory. I installed a number of wordpress projects but non of them seemed to be what I am looking for.</p>

<p>So I started to look for a Laravel starter project that i can work with.</p>

<p>I am going to install each one and write a blog on the experience of each.</p>

<h4>https://github.com/laravel-frontend-presets/tailwindcss</h4>

<p>I was looking for something simple with just tailwind and laravel so i also found this:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/laravel-frontend-presets/tailwindcss">laravel frontend presets / tailwindcss</a></p>

<p>You start with a default laravel install and justs add the presets on top.</p>

<h4>Jeremy Kenedy / laravel-auth</h4>

<p>I have used this project in the past and found it great.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jeremykenedy/laravel-auth" target="_blank">laravel-auth</a></p>

<h4>innocenzi / laravel-boilerplate</h4>

<p><a href="https://github.com/innocenzi/laravel-boilerplate" target="_blank">laravel-boilerplate</a></p>

<h4>nasirkhan / laravel-starter</h4>

<p><a href="https://github.com/nasirkhan/laravel-starter" target="_blank">nasirkhan/laravel-starter</a></p>

<h4>rappasoft / Laravel Boilerplate</h4>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rappasoft/laravel-boilerplate">Laravel Boilerplate</a></p>

<h4>laraship-laravel-directory</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.laraship.com/product/laraship-laravel-directory/" target="_blank">laraship laravel directory</a></p>

<p>Not really a starter project, more of a solution of what i am trying to offer.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>I have been running this website for a few months and what started as an experiment I am rather enjoying as a place to write and play around with Code and more.</p>

<p>But one thing I checked yesterday, was how many pages were indexed by Google.</p>

<p>Google search for "site:http://allotmentandy.github.io/" and the answer was NONE - ZERO - ZILCH - NADA!!</p>

<p>But Google provided a handy link to its Google Search Console. So i managed to login to my Google account, added a meta tag to the layout template and managed to get Google to index the site. Today there are 8 pages in the Google index. Which is better.</p>

<p>Small wins each day! Of those 8 pages, 3 only have 'AllotmentAndy' as the title, The blog index page has 'AllotmentAndy - GitHub Pages' as the title and the others have 'AllotmentAndy - PAGE TITLE'</p>

<p>Will see how this changes over the next few days.</p>

<p>Would like to improve the Title tags for the static pages in the root. I have added some yaml to the top of the web safe fonts page to improve the title tag. Lets see how long it takes Google to notice!</p>

        <h3>Directory websites in Wordpress</h3>

<p>Back in 1998, i registered a url, londinium.com and built a website directory. Over the years, i built quite a nice website, with over 100,000 links to mainly London based information. However in 2015, it started to be bought down daily by DDOS attacks. It was also removed from google searches and the revenue went down towards zero. So i shut it down.</p>

<p>Since then, i have tried with a shopify online store, but that hasnt worked.</p>

<p>So i come back to the idea of a London directory website, but want to make it more useful.</p>

<p>So i am going to look at Wordpress plugins to re-launch londinium.</p>

<p>These are the wordpress directories i have looked at, to be far i wasnt too impressed with any of them.</p>

<h2>Wordpress Directories Plugins</h2>

<h4>Geo-directory</h4>

<p><a href="https://wpgeodirectory.com/" target="_blank">Geo-directory</a><br />
<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/geodirectory/" target="_blank">Geo-directory on Wordpress</a></p>

<h4>Business Directory</h4>

<p><a href="https://businessdirectoryplugin.com/" target="_blank">Business Directory</a><br />
<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/business-directory-plugin/" target="_blank">Business Directory on Wordpress</a></p>

<h4>Advanced Classifieds &amp; Directory Pro</h4>

<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-classifieds-and-directory-pro/" target="_blank">Advanced Classifieds &amp; Directory Pro on Wordpress</a></p>

<h4>Hivepress</h4>

<p>This looked the most impressive on first glimpse, but the demo content wouldnt import and after a few tries i gave up.</p>

<p><a href="https://hivepress.io/" target="_blank">Hivepress</a><br />
<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/hivepress/" target="_blank">Hivepress on Wordpress</a></p>

<h4>Web Directory Free</h4>

<a href="[https://wordpress.org/plugins/web-directory-free/]" target="_blank">Web Directory Free on Wordpress</a></p>

<p>I would be interested in seeing websites that use any of these plugins and chat to users of these plugins, but it looks like I am going to have to build something myself.</p>

        <p>I have always been a fan of RSS feeds going back years. In case you don't know, RSS feeds (and ATOM feeds) are text files that provide the latest pages from a website. I use them for News, website statuses and more.</p>

<p>I use a number of RSS feed readers on my Debian machine and wanted to highlight what I like about each one.</p>

<h3>QuiteRSS</h3>

<p>My main RSS feed reader, i like it, but it is a little slow to open and close. One small problem I have is that when i open it, it is always set to "ALWAYS ON TOP". Everytime I open QuiteRSS, i have to untick the "ALWAYS ON TOP" setting in the right click. I cannot find how this has been set in the settings/options panels. Maybe this is a feature I discovered in another window manager, as i used LXDE earlier. Any ideas how to unset this?</p>

<p>All round, i like QuiteRSS, it doesnt have a progress box to show downloads, something I would like to see as i often work with sporadic internet connections.</p>

<p>There is an ability to search within one feed, but thats not how I need to search.</p>

<p>One really annoying feature is if you click on the line between the news items in a feed, it decides to open in a browser. This also tends to open a new browser window, but as i am offline, it just gives an error page.</p>

<p>Another strange feature is that many articles are marked as read, even thou i havent had a chance to read the feeds. I tend to go to the wireless hotspot, download all the feeds and go back to my desk to read them. But they are often marked read.</p>

<p>I use QuiteRSS as my main feed reader, but am open to new ways. So i tried the following apps, but none quite did it for me!</p>

<h3>Liferea</h3>

<p>I like the way you can read the unread feeds across all the feeds in the app. This is how i have gone through the feeds, but it is a little unnerving when they disappear after you click on the next one. But i suppose this is now not unread!</p>

<p>I also liked the way there was a make folder option, QuiteRSS doesnt offer folders for the feeds, so they are all in one long list. The problem with Liferea is that any folder I make, doesn't actually appear.</p>

<h3>Akregator</h3>

<p>After finding a number of OPML files (rss backups) on github, I wanted to see what these feeds offered, but didnt want to clog up QuiteRSS or Liferea with other peoples feeds, so i used Akregator.</p>

<p>Akregator was quite minimal, but let me import 5 opml files with ease and read the feeds.</p>

<p>However, after shutting down Akregator (or so i thought) It seems to keep a background process running which created errors as i am offline a lot.</p>

<p>So now i dont use Akregator much as that background process wasnt what i wanted.</p>

<h3>Newsboat</h3>

<p>I installed a Command Line (CLI) to test out what RSS feeds were like from the command line. I imported my main opml file to give it a whirl, but on reopening the app after the first feed update, all the feeds were gone. So i gave up on that one.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I would be interested in any solutions to issues i have written about here. You can contact me via <a href="https://www.github.com/allotmentandy1">twitter</a>
If you can share your feeds via .OPML files I would love to see what you read.</p>

        <h3>Why is music such a pleasure?</h3>

<p>There was a website a long time ago called the World Question Centre, where they asked famous people to ask one question. One of the respondents asked <em>Why is music such a pleasure?</em> I always loved this questions as I see it as perfect.</p>

<p>I have also used this question to test people. If I say this to you and you try to answer it, you have missed the point. The answer isnt in something in the ears and brain or any other reason. It is just a great question, it is not a test to answer. I am looking for people who say, <em>What a great question</em>.</p>

<p>IBM used to test people like this, if you were looking for work at IBM, they would take you to dinner to sillently test you. Once you got your food, if you put salt and pepper on before tasting it, you failed! They are looking for people who fit a high quality culture. I notice people putting on salt and pepper often and think of this.</p>

<p>There are a number of other questions i like to ask to test people and see what they are made of. For example, another question is, <em>Where does money come from, how is it made?</em></p>

<p>This sort of testing people is to route out people who do not think and just live in a bubble of ignorance. I am not trying to say I am right here, just it is a waste of time to engage with people who cannot question what they think they know. How can these help you improve if they do not improve themselves.</p>

        <p>One thing i really liked about this Jigsaw static site generator is it comes with Tailwind Css and a working Laravel Mix / Webpack / PurgeCSS solution.</p>

<p>Tailwind CSS is much more like coding CSS / HTML about 20 years ago. But the difference being you can do soo much with a core set of standard css options.</p>

<p>The advantage is that you just write the html with classes that make sense to the context of what you are doing with the html element.</p>

        <p>Alongside playing with code, i like to learn Portuguese. So i was wondering this morning the best way to make a Portuguese version of the site.</p>

<p>I would like a language switcher to swap between EN and PT at first. This would change the nav, footer and buttons across the site. Perhaps there could be a posts_pt directory for tranlsated posts, which i would like to have auto-translated by some online gizmo (google)?</p>

<p>I wonder if this the way others have tackled this problem in the past.</p>

<p>Can javascript detect the locale? i need to search this next.</p>

<p>I have created an <a href="/about-pt/">/about_pt</a> page to experiment with this</p>

        <p>I was looking for a project to help me do a few things. write a blog, store
reference material for things I am interested in, create a database of plants
I like to grow, learn about markdown &amp; JSON and also expand my use of shell
scripts.</p>

<p>Having been online for 25 years, I have gone from an all rounder managing CSS,
graphics, code and servers back to being an all rounder doing the same thing.
In the intervening years, I have worked with PHP, Codeigniter and now mainly
Laravel and have set up this system to allow me to entertain myself whilst
(re)learning CSS, Javascript, Markdown, JSON, Bash Scripting and Graphic
Design, something I have ignore for too long.</p>

<p>Having moved to using Debian Linux as my main daily machine, I have enjoyed
setting up a number of projects but wanted somewhere to combine and publish my
writing and experiments for all to see.</p>

<p>So although I had known about Jigsaw for years as a Laravel developer, i
recently took the plunge and installed it. I have tried a number of other
static site generators including Hugo and Jekyll but they didn't really click
with me for a number of reasons. Although I have 'played' with Ruby, Go and
Python, I tend to fall back to bash and PHP as the languages i like. I also
wanted something that wasn't huge, but powerful enough for me get stuff done
without a huge learning curve.</p>

<p>So Jigsaw uses the Laravel Blade syntax that I have used in many other
projects and comes with a neat quick start blog with a nifty search facility
from fuse.js which uses json. I created a site with a blog (_posts) and static
pages (_pages), but the search facility only indexed the blog. No problem, i
created a new collection in the generateIndex handle method and merged the 2
collections, then hey presto, it worked.</p>

<p>There are a number of features I liked 'out of the box' there was a RSS/ATOM
feed included. This is great as I am a big fan of the RSS feed concept.</p>

<p>The basic app also had a category system which I have included via an
autogenerated collection in the config file.</p>

<p>The Jigsaw blog system also uses Tailwind CSS, Webpack and Laravel Mix to
process the CSS and Js with the <code>npm run dev</code> and <code>npm run production</code>
commands.</p>

<p>I have really quite enjoyed the experience and will publish this all on
github.io and github.com/allotmentandy in the near future. Enjoying working
with CSS and next for the imagery.</p>

<p>Playing with the SVG image format is also on the to-do list.</p>

<h4>Observations</h4>

<p>[ ] fuse.js search json generator only takes the first 255 chars of the page
content.</p>

<p>[ ] the build process is very fast, taking about 0.2 seconds to build the
site.</p>

<p>[ ] Tailwind CSS is really nice once you get your head around it, it is like
CSS used to be.</p>

<p>[ ] I miss the 'php artisan' commands, i want a script to create a blog page
for today, with the date and time now, the filename i give it and a basic div.
like this <code>php artisan make:post 'title of post'</code> but i will make it in bash</p>

        <p>8.15am in bed, it is raining, wondering what to do today.</p>

<p>I have been using Debian Linux for years, I guess about version 5. Recently I
found the 4.9 kernel caused the computer to lock / freeze completely, with an
upgrade to the 4.19 kernel even worse. So I backed up my machine and installed
Debian testing! This fixed the freezing issue and the computer has not crashed
in weeks.</p>

<h2>Today i learnt</h2>

<p>to show all installed apps in debian with a description</p>

<pre><code>dpkg-query -l
</code></pre>

<h2>Jigsaw</h2>

<p>Building this website using the jigsaw static site, but as default the search
only worked for the _posts pages, so i added a new collection to the search
json and merged them together. now you can search all the pages. Must look
into the Fuse.js that is making it.</p>

<h3>Update - 23.05pm -</h3>

<p>Have had a good day, learning Markdown, Tailwind CSS, Jigsaw Static Site
development. Found some good docs on the internet to help me learn all this.</p>
