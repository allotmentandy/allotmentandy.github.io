        <p>I used to love listening to the radio, over 20 years ago i would listen to the BBC World Service and it was great. I lived in Italy and I used to enjoy programmes like 'World Business Report' and also John Peal presenting 'Home Truths.'</p>

<p>Today, i dont turn on the radio in the morning, BBC Radio 4 is unlistenable, a steam of wet lefties lying with nothing much to say. It is an outrage that residents of the UK must pay (with force of prison) to fund the BBC which is so far removed from their beliefs.</p>

<p>In fact, where i am, we hardely even turn on the telly news anymore. The bbc has become unwatchable with its mix of wet leftism and bias by omission.</p>

<p>And having worked recently at a major UK newspaper which is infested with the same sort of wets. How the expect to survive over time is not a problem for me, like all things infected with leftism, i hope they just fade away.</p>

        <p>I was looking for a project to help me do a few things. write a blog, store
reference material for things I am interested in, create a database of plants
I like to grow, learn about markdown &amp; JSON and also expand my use of shell
scripts.</p>

<p>Having been online for 25 years, I have gone from an all rounder managing CSS,
graphics, code and servers back to being an all rounder doing the same thing.
In the intervening years, I have worked with PHP, Codeigniter and now mainly
Laravel and have set up this system to allow me to entertain myself whilst
(re)learning CSS, Javascript, Markdown, JSON, Bash Scripting and Graphic
Design, something I have ignore for too long.</p>

<p>Having moved to using Debian Linux as my main daily machine, I have enjoyed
setting up a number of projects but wanted somewhere to combine and publish my
writing and experiments for all to see.</p>

<p>So although I had known about Jigsaw for years as a Laravel developer, i
recently took the plunge and installed it. I have tried a number of other
static site generators including Hugo and Jekyll but they didn't really click
with me for a number of reasons. Although I have 'played' with Ruby, Go and
Python, I tend to fall back to bash and PHP as the languages i like. I also
wanted something that wasn't huge, but powerful enough for me get stuff done
without a huge learning curve.</p>

<p>So Jigsaw uses the Laravel Blade syntax that I have used in many other
projects and comes with a neat quick start blog with a nifty search facility
from fuse.js which uses json. I created a site with a blog (_posts) and static
pages (_pages), but the search facility only indexed the blog. No problem, i
created a new collection in the generateIndex handle method and merged the 2
collections, then hey presto, it worked.</p>

<p>There are a number of features I liked 'out of the box' there was a RSS/ATOM
feed included. This is great as I am a big fan of the RSS feed concept.</p>

<p>The basic app also had a category system which I have included via an
autogenerated collection in the config file.</p>

<p>The Jigsaw blog system also uses Tailwind CSS, Webpack and Laravel Mix to
process the CSS and Js with the <code>npm run dev</code> and <code>npm run production</code>
commands.</p>

<p>I have really quite enjoyed the experience and will publish this all on
github.io and github.com/allotmentandy in the near future. Enjoying working
with CSS and next for the imagery.</p>

<p>Playing with the SVG image format is also on the to-do list.</p>

<h4>Observations</h4>

<p>[ ] fuse.js search json generator only takes the first 255 chars of the page
content.</p>

<p>[ ] the build process is very fast, taking about 0.2 seconds to build the
site.</p>

<p>[ ] Tailwind CSS is really nice once you get your head around it, it is like
CSS used to be.</p>

<p>[ ] I miss the 'php artisan' commands, i want a script to create a blog page
for today, with the date and time now, the filename i give it and a basic div.
like this <code>php artisan make:post 'title of post'</code> but i will make it in bash</p>

        <p>8.15am in bed, it is raining, wondering what to do today.</p>

<h2>Thoughts about Debian</h2>

<p>I have been using Debian Linux for years, I guess about version 5. Recently I
found the 4.9 kernel caused the computer to lock / freeze completely, with an
upgrade to the 4.19 kernel even worse. So I backed up my machine and installed
Debian testing! This fixed the freezing issue and the computer has not crashed
in weeks.</p>

<h2>Today i learnt</h2>

<p>to show all installed apps in debian with a description</p>

<pre><code>dpkg-query -l
</code></pre>

<h2>Jigsaw</h2>

<p>Building this website using the jigsaw static site, but as default the search
only worked for the _posts pages, so i added a new collection to the search
json and merged them together. now you can search all the pages. Must look
into the Fuse.js that is making it.</p>

<h3>Update - 23.05pm -</h3>

<p>Have had a good day, learning Markdown, Tailwind CSS, Jigsaw Static Site
development. Found some good docs on the internet to help me learn all this.</p>
