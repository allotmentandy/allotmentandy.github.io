        <p>This is a post about a project I have in mind to buy some land in Portugal.</p>

<p>I would like to buy a small plot of land from about 500 to 2500 metres. The area I am looking for is North of Lisbon, near to Coimbra. Here is a link to <a href="https://www.idealista.pt/en/areas/comprar-terrenos/com-preco-max_100000,tamanho-min_100,terreno-urbano,terreno-urbanizavel/?shape=%28%28abpnFpo%7Cw%40cmnGqihCmcG%7BtrAregHh%60%5DasOb%7E%7DD%29%29&amp;ordem=precos-asc">Idealista</a></p>

<p>I dont mind if the land is infested with bamboo, but i would like it to have some fruit trees and vines.</p>

<p>My plans is to come at the end of September to look for land to buy.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>I have been trying a number of new things to try and get work.</p>

<p>Firstly i discovered <a href="http://www.nextdoor.co.uk">nextdoor.co.uk</a> a localised website for helping people communicate with each other. The site excited me at first and I managed to post a number of messages about potential jobs/work. The first one about IT work got one response, I elderly gentleman who wanted help 'in the future' with setting up a laptop, security and more. However, he has never got back to me and I dont hold out much hope that he will. The second post was offering gardening work, something I can do and enjoy. This too had one response, from a lady nearby. I wondered round, to find a tiny garden, but alas the women had no money to pay for the work and was just trying to get me to do it as a portfolio piece. Hmm. Further posts have gotten me nowhere except I guy that asked for a day or twos labour, and then cancelled the day before as his cousin was coming and would do it for free. Great.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I emailed / contacted around 10 local gardening firms about gardening work and have got zero replies. Great.</p>

<p>Yesterday I also looked at finding potential work on <a href="https://www.upwork.com">Upwork.com</a> A website for freelancers and companies to content for work. I have used this website before and also elance which they have taken over in the past. I preferred elance as it worked better without all the fancy javascript which doesn't quite work. Now though, Upwork has created a type of currency called 'connects' which you have to buy for the right to connect with potential jobs. I have used this site to hire programmers in the past, and the spam was very high.</p>

<p>So still trying to find work, any ideas?</p>

    <summary type="html">Getting the RSS and ATOM feeds from a website....</summary>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>This morning I decided to look into getting the RSS/ATOM feed links from websites. I am building a new Spider for Londinium.com and have made this simple package for PHP to extract links.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/allotmentandy/SocialMediaLinkExtractor">Social Media Link Extractor</a></p>

<p>I updated the package this morning but then realised it wont really work as RSS feeds (and ATOM feeds) are linked in the head of the html like so:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="RSS Feed" href="http://example.org/rss" /&gt;

&lt;link rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" title="RSS Feed" href="http://example.org/feed" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>you can see here how i added code to the spider to get these rss feeds and it works.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/allotmentandy/laravel54/blob/master/app/Http/Controllers/LondiniumController.php#L405">laravel54</a></p>

<p>Having run the spider, I can now see that some sites dont put the full URL on, so you get /rss.xml 
which isnt great as now i have to combine the domain name with the feed, dealing with any directories, filenames and .types. but it is better than nowt.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>Yesterday i wrote about how i was looking at wordpress and laravel starter projects to build a website directory. I installed a number of wordpress projects but non of them seemed to be what I am looking for.</p>

<p>So I started to look for a Laravel starter project that i can work with.</p>

<p>I am going to install each one and write a blog on the experience of each.</p>

<h4>https://github.com/laravel-frontend-presets/tailwindcss</h4>

<p>I was looking for something simple with just tailwind and laravel so i also found this:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/laravel-frontend-presets/tailwindcss">laravel frontend presets / tailwindcss</a></p>

<p>You start with a default laravel install and justs add the presets on top.</p>

<h4>Jeremy Kenedy / laravel-auth</h4>

<p>I have used this project in the past and found it great.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jeremykenedy/laravel-auth" title="" target="_blank">laravel-auth</a></p>

<h4>innocenzi / laravel-boilerplate</h4>

<p><a href="https://github.com/innocenzi/laravel-boilerplate" title="" target="_blank">laravel-boilerplate</a></p>

<h4>nasirkhan / laravel-starter</h4>

<p><a href="https://github.com/nasirkhan/laravel-starter" title="" target="_blank">nasirkhan/laravel-starter</a></p>

<h4>rappasoft / Laravel Boilerplate</h4>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rappasoft/laravel-boilerplate">Laravel Boilerplate</a></p>

<h4>laraship-laravel-directory</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.laraship.com/product/laraship-laravel-directory/" title="" target="_blank">laraship laravel directory</a></p>

<p>Not really a starter project, more of a solution of what i am trying to offer.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>I have been running this website for a few months and what started as an experiment I am rather enjoying as a place to write and play around with Code and more.</p>

<p>But one thing I checked yesterday, was how many pages were indexed by Google.</p>

<p>Google search for "site:http://allotmentandy.github.io/" and the answer was NONE - ZERO - ZILCH - NADA!!</p>

<p>But Google provided a handy link to its Google Search Console. So i managed to login to my Google account, added a meta tag to the layout template and managed to get Google to index the site. Today there are 8 pages in the Google index. Which is better.</p>

<p>Small wins each day! Of those 8 pages, 3 only have 'AllotmentAndy' as the title, The blog index page has 'AllotmentAndy - GitHub Pages' as the title and the others have 'AllotmentAndy - PAGE TITLE'</p>

<p>Will see how this changes over the next few days.</p>

<p>Would like to improve the Title tags for the static pages in the root. I have added some yaml to the top of the web safe fonts page to improve the title tag. Lets see how long it takes Google to notice!</p>

        <h3>Directory websites in Wordpress</h3>

<p>Back in 1998, i registered a url, londinium.com and built a website directory. Over the years, i built quite a nice website, with over 100,000 links to mainly London based information. However in 2015, it started to be bought down daily by DDOS attacks. It was also removed from google searches and the revenue went down towards zero. So i shut it down.</p>

<p>Since then, i have tried with a shopify online store, but that hasnt worked.</p>

<p>So i come back to the idea of a London directory website, but want to make it more useful.</p>

<p>So i am going to look at Wordpress plugins to re-launch londinium.</p>

<p>These are the wordpress directories i have looked at, to be far i wasnt too impressed with any of them.</p>

<h2>Wordpress Directories Plugins</h2>

<h4>Geo-directory</h4>

<p><a href="https://wpgeodirectory.com/" title="" target="_blank">Geo-directory</a><br />
<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/geodirectory/" title="" target="_blank">Geo-directory on Wordpress</a></p>

<h4>Business Directory</h4>

<p><a href="https://businessdirectoryplugin.com/" title="" target="_blank">Business Directory</a><br />
<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/business-directory-plugin/" title="" target="_blank">Business Directory on Wordpress</a></p>

<h4>Advanced Classifieds &amp; Directory Pro</h4>

<p><a href="https://pluginsware.com/" title="" target="_blank">Pluginsware</a><br />
<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-classifieds-and-directory-pro/" title="" target="_blank">Advanced Classifieds &amp; Directory Pro on Wordpress</a></p>

<h4>Hivepress</h4>

<p>This looked the most impressive on first glimpse, but the demo content wouldnt import and after a few tries i gave up.</p>

<p><a href="https://hivepress.io/" title="" target="_blank">Hivepress</a><br />
<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/hivepress/" title="" target="_blank">Hivepress on Wordpress</a></p>

<h4>Web Directory Free</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.salephpscripts.com/wordpress_directory/demo/" title="" target="_blank">Web Directory Free</a><br />
<a href="[https://wordpress.org/plugins/web-directory-free/]" title="" target="_blank">Web Directory Free on Wordpress</a></p>

<p>I would be interested in seeing websites that use any of these plugins and chat to users of these plugins, but it looks like I am going to have to build something myself.</p>

        <p>I have always been a fan of RSS feeds going back years. In case you don't know, RSS feeds (and ATOM feeds) are text files that provide the latest pages from a website. I use them for News, website statuses and more.</p>

<p>I use a number of RSS feed readers on my Debian machine and wanted to highlight what I like about each one.</p>

<h3>QuiteRSS</h3>

<p>My main RSS feed reader, i like it, but it is a little slow to open and close. One small problem I have is that when i open it, it is always set to "ALWAYS ON TOP". Everytime I open QuiteRSS, i have to untick the "ALWAYS ON TOP" setting in the right click. I cannot find how this has been set in the settings/options panels. Maybe this is a feature I discovered in another window manager, as i used LXDE earlier. Any ideas how to unset this?</p>

<p>All round, i like QuiteRSS, it doesnt have a progress box to show downloads, something I would like to see as i often work with sporadic internet connections.</p>

<p>There is an ability to search within one feed, but thats not how I need to search.</p>

<p>One really annoying feature is if you click on the line between the news items in a feed, it decides to open in a browser. This also tends to open a new browser window, but as i am offline, it just gives an error page.</p>

<p>Another strange feature is that many articles are marked as read, even thou i havent had a chance to read the feeds. I tend to go to the wireless hotspot, download all the feeds and go back to my desk to read them. But they are often marked read.</p>

<p>I use QuiteRSS as my main feed reader, but am open to new ways. So i tried the following apps, but none quite did it for me!</p>

<h3>Liferea</h3>

<p>I like the way you can read the unread feeds across all the feeds in the app. This is how i have gone through the feeds, but it is a little unnerving when they disappear after you click on the next one. But i suppose this is now not unread!</p>

<p>I also liked the way there was a make folder option, QuiteRSS doesnt offer folders for the feeds, so they are all in one long list. The problem with Liferea is that any folder I make, doesn't actually appear.</p>

<h3>Akregator</h3>

<p>After finding a number of OPML files (rss backups) on github, I wanted to see what these feeds offered, but didnt want to clog up QuiteRSS or Liferea with other peoples feeds, so i used Akregator.</p>

<p>Akregator was quite minimal, but let me import 5 opml files with ease and read the feeds.</p>

<p>However, after shutting down Akregator (or so i thought) It seems to keep a background process running which created errors as i am offline a lot.</p>

<p>So now i dont use Akregator much as that background process wasnt what i wanted.</p>

<h3>Newsboat</h3>

<p>I installed a Command Line (CLI) to test out what RSS feeds were like from the command line. I imported my main opml file to give it a whirl, but on reopening the app after the first feed update, all the feeds were gone. So i gave up on that one.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I would be interested in any solutions to issues i have written about here. You can contact me via <a href="https://www.github.com/allotmentandy1">twitter</a>
If you can share your feeds via .OPML files I would love to see what you read.</p>

        <h3>Why is music such a pleasure?</h3>

<p>There was a website a long time ago called the World Question Centre, where they asked famous people to ask one question. One of the respondents asked <em>Why is music such a pleasure?</em> I always loved this questions as I see it as perfect.</p>

<p>I have also used this question to test people. If I say this to you and you try to answer it, you have missed the point. The answer isnt in something in the ears and brain or any other reason. It is just a great question, it is not a test to answer. I am looking for people who say, <em>What a great question</em>.</p>

<p>IBM used to test people like this, if you were looking for work at IBM, they would take you to dinner to sillently test you. Once you got your food, if you put salt and pepper on before tasting it, you failed! They are looking for people who fit a high quality culture. I notice people putting on salt and pepper often and think of this.</p>

<p>There are a number of other questions i like to ask to test people and see what they are made of. For example, another question is, <em>Where does money come from, how is it made?</em></p>

<p>This sort of testing people is to route out people who do not think and just live in a bubble of ignorance. I am not trying to say I am right here, just it is a waste of time to engage with people who cannot question what they think they know. How can these help you improve if they do not improve themselves.</p>

<p>On a personal note, i was given a nickname last year, WOODY, which was the name of the 3rd version of Debian! Lovely...</p>

        <p>One thing i really liked about this Jigsaw static site generator is it comes with Tailwind Css and a working Laravel Mix / Webpack / PurgeCSS solution.</p>

<p>Tailwind CSS is much more like coding CSS / HTML about 20 years ago. But the difference being you can do soo much with a core set of standard css options.</p>

<p>The advantage is that you just write the html with classes that make sense to the context of what you are doing with the html element.</p>

        <p>Alongside playing with code, i like to learn Portuguese. So i was wondering this morning the best way to make a Portuguese version of the site.</p>

<p>I would like a language switcher to swap between EN and PT at first. This would change the nav, footer and buttons across the site. Perhaps there could be a posts_pt directory for tranlsated posts, which i would like to have auto-translated by some online gizmo (google)?</p>

<p>I wonder if this the way others have tackled this problem in the past.</p>

<p>Can javascript detect the locale? i need to search this next.</p>

<p>I have created an <a href="/about-pt/">/about_pt</a> page to experiment with this</p>

        <p>I was looking for a project to help me do a few things. write a blog, store
reference material for things I am interested in, create a database of plants
I like to grow, learn about markdown &amp; JSON and also expand my use of shell
scripts.</p>

<p>Having been online for 25 years, I have gone from an all rounder managing CSS,
graphics, code and servers back to being an all rounder doing the same thing.
In the intervening years, I have worked with PHP, Codeigniter and now mainly
Laravel and have set up this system to allow me to entertain myself whilst
(re)learning CSS, Javascript, Markdown, JSON, Bash Scripting and Graphic
Design, something I have ignore for too long.</p>

<p>Having moved to using Debian Linux as my main daily machine, I have enjoyed
setting up a number of projects but wanted somewhere to combine and publish my
writing and experiments for all to see.</p>

<p>So although I had known about Jigsaw for years as a Laravel developer, i
recently took the plunge and installed it. I have tried a number of other
static site generators including Hugo and Jekyll but they didn't really click
with me for a number of reasons. Although I have 'played' with Ruby, Go and
Python, I tend to fall back to bash and PHP as the languages i like. I also
wanted something that wasn't huge, but powerful enough for me get stuff done
without a huge learning curve.</p>

<p>So Jigsaw uses the Laravel Blade syntax that I have used in many other
projects and comes with a neat quick start blog with a nifty search facility
from fuse.js which uses json. I created a site with a blog (_posts) and static
pages (_pages), but the search facility only indexed the blog. No problem, i
created a new collection in the generateIndex handle method and merged the 2
collections, then hey presto, it worked.</p>

<p>There are a number of features I liked 'out of the box' there was a RSS/ATOM
feed included. This is great as I am a big fan of the RSS feed concept.</p>

<p>The basic app also had a category system which I have included via an
autogenerated collection in the config file.</p>

<p>The Jigsaw blog system also uses Tailwind CSS, Webpack and Laravel Mix to
process the CSS and Js with the <code>npm run dev</code> and <code>npm run production</code>
commands.</p>

<p>I have really quite enjoyed the experience and will publish this all on
github.io and github.com/allotmentandy in the near future. Enjoying working
with CSS and next for the imagery.</p>

<p>Playing with the SVG image format is also on the to-do list.</p>

<h4>Observations</h4>

<p>[ ] fuse.js search json generator only takes the first 255 chars of the page
content.</p>

<p>[ ] the build process is very fast, taking about 0.2 seconds to build the
site.</p>

<p>[ ] Tailwind CSS is really nice once you get your head around it, it is like
CSS used to be.</p>

<p>[ ] I miss the 'php artisan' commands, i want a script to create a blog page
for today, with the date and time now, the filename i give it and a basic div.
like this <code>php artisan make:post 'title of post'</code> but i will make it in bash</p>

upgrade to the 4.19 kernel even worse. So I backed up my machine and installed
Debian testing! This fixed the freezing issue and the computer has not crashed
in weeks.</p>

<h2>Today i learnt</h2>

<p>to show all installed apps in debian with a description</p>

<pre><code>dpkg-query -l
</code></pre>

<h2>Jigsaw</h2>

<p>Building this website using the jigsaw static site, but as default the search
only worked for the _posts pages, so i added a new collection to the search
json and merged them together. now you can search all the pages. Must look
into the Fuse.js that is making it.</p>

<h3>Update - 23.05pm -</h3>

<p>Have had a good day, learning Markdown, Tailwind CSS, Jigsaw Static Site
development. Found some good docs on the internet to help me learn all this.</p>
